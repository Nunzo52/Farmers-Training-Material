## 🏠 Overview  
This section explains **property floaters**—endorsements used to properly insure **jewelry, cameras, musical instruments, firearms, fine arts, and collectibles** when standard homeowners/renters/condo policies cap coverage.  

Floaters solve problems like:  
- 💍 **Mysterious disappearance** (stone falls out, ring slips off in water) → ❌ excluded in base policies, ✅ covered by floater.  
- 🎨 Covering **unique/rare value** items like fine art, rare books, collectibles.  
- 📷 Broader coverage for **cameras & instruments**, including accidental breakage.

## 💎 Jewelry — The Six C’s  
Jewelry insurance isn’t just about Tiffany’s 4 C’s (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carat). Insurance adds 2 more:  
- 💎 **Cut**  
- 🌈 **Color**  
- 🔍 **Clarity**  
- ⚖️ **Carat weight**  
- 🛡️ **Coverage**  
- 💰 **Cost**  

### 🔑 Key Limits  
- **Smart Plan Home (base):** $1,000 per item | $2,500 total (theft only).  
- **Premier Endorsement:** $1,500/item | $5,000 total.  
- **Renters (legacy):** only $500 theft limit.  
- **Next-Gen / Smart Plan Renters:** better base limits.  

➡️ Fire loss = paid under **Coverage C** (contents), not floater limit.  
➡️ Theft = **floater needed** for meaningful protection.  

### ❌ Not Covered  
- Mysterious disappearance under base policies.  
- Example: Ring slips off in river → **no coverage** without floater.  

---

## 📷 Cameras & 🎶 Instruments  
- ✅ Covered on floaters for theft, breakage, disappearance.  
- ⚠️ **Professional/paid use:** Not covered unless explicitly endorsed.  
  - Example: Jazz band saxophone → must check “Business Use” box.  
  - Real estate agent camera use = 🚩 underwriting/claims gray area.  

### Why Floater Matters  
- Falls, drops, drink spills, stage damage = **covered** under floater, not under HO policy.  
- Theft: HO covers cameras normally, but floater adds broader “all-risk” coverage.  

---

## 🔫 Firearms & Silverware  
- **Smart Plan HO limits:** $2,000 firearms theft | $2,500 silverware theft.  
- Floater allows:  
  - Scheduling specific high-value firearms.  
  - Covering cases, ammo, and accessories.  
- ❌ Not allowed: Illegal/modified weapons, business use without disclosure.  

---

## 🎨 Fine Arts, Books, Collectibles  
- ✅ Can cover paintings, sculptures, antique furniture, rare books, coin/stamp collections.  
- 📌 **Exhibit Exclusion:** Not covered when on display at fairs, museums, libraries → must rely on exhibitor’s insurance.  
- 📚 Rare books: HO covers basic fire loss but **not collectible value** → floater required.  

---

## ⚖️ Valuation & Appraisal Rules  
- **<$5,000:** Receipt sufficient.  
- **$5,001–$10,000:** Appraisal within 5 years.  
- **$10,000+:** Appraisal within 3 years.  
- **Minimum limit per floater item:** $1,500.  
- **Max per item:** $50,000 (exceptions with UW approval).  
- **Aggregate limit:** $100,000 (standard; UW can approve higher for strong accounts).  

### 🟢 Agreed Value Option  
- Locks in payout at scheduled amount.  
- Costs more, but no debate at claim time.  
- Example: $7,500 Rolex = guaranteed payout even if market value drops.  

---

## 🛡️ Deductibles & Binding Authority  
- Floaters can have **separate deductibles** (often $0–$500).  
- Binding authority rules:  
  - $1,500–$5,000: receipt required.  
  - $5,001–$10,000: appraisal ≤5 years.  
  - $10,000+: appraisal ≤3 years.  

---

## 📌 Colorado-Specific Notes  
- 🏔️ **Wind/hail deductibles** may apply separately (often % of Coverage A).  
- 🪟 **Roof surface schedules** required per CO Division of Insurance (post-2019 regs).  
- Jewelry floaters in CO often require **updated appraisals** to avoid undervaluation disputes.  
- Agents should highlight **state filing differences**—e.g., no coinsurance on floaters but roof schedules still apply.  

---

## 🚩 Red Flags (Underwriting / Claims)  
- Jewelry added without appraisal → 🚫 potential fraud.  
- Cameras or instruments used for **business** without disclosure.  
- Items with cracks, broken prongs, or existing damage.  
- Art displayed outside residence premises.  
- High-value pieces (> $50k) without UW pre-approval.  

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways  
- Floaters = essential for **high-value personal property**.  
- Always ask about **mysterious disappearance concerns**—this drives floater sales.  
- Jewelry, fine arts, and collectibles need **regular appraisal updates**.  
- ✅ Colorado agents must disclose **wind/hail deductibles** and **roof schedules** separately from floater discussions.
