# Fire 202 ‚Äî Inspecting Homes

## üîé Overview
This module focuses on the **responsibility to inspect homes**, ensuring accurate rebuild values, and how inspections tie into underwriting integrity.

---

## üè† Insurance to Value
- Agents must verify details in **360 Value** rather than relying on auto-calculated numbers.
- Incorrect data (stories, quality grade, exterior finish) = **wrong rebuild estimate**.
- Quality grade depends on materials (flooring, counters, drywall, etc.), not just neighborhood comparison.
- Foundation corners impact rebuilding cost (more corners = higher cost).

---

## üìä Cost per Square Foot
- Farmers requires **minimum per-square-foot insured value** for **Guaranteed Replacement Cost endorsement** (except CA & AR).
- Example: Plano, TX ZIP 75024 ‚Üí $131.10/sq ft minimum.
- Not the rebuild cost itself, just the threshold for eligibility.

---

## üß± Construction Impacts
- **Wall space:** 2-story homes have more linear feet of walls vs. same-size 1-story ‚Üí higher siding costs.
- **Roofing:** 1-story homes usually have larger roof surface ‚Üí higher roofing costs.
- **Bathrooms & water damage:** More bathrooms = higher water claim risk.
- **Stories & water damage:** 2-story homes with upstairs baths = greater water loss severity.

---

## üí° Key Risk Factors
- Roof type: **3-tab vs. architectural shingles** = biggest agent reporting error.
- Exterior finish: **Brick veneer vs. stone veneer** affects rebuild cost.
- Interior details: Google Street View / 360 Value cannot capture inside (water stains, pets, clutter, etc.).
- **Satellite images** may reveal pools, solar panels, or remodels invisible from street view.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Agent Responsibilities
- By contract, insureds are responsible for correct info.
- In practice: **agents act as field underwriters** to ensure accuracy.
- Must inspect, document, and submit:
  - All 4 sides of dwelling
  - Roof material & condition
  - Separate structures
  - House number visible

---

## üì∑ Inspection Tools
- **Google Street View:** Outdated, misses backyard, hazards, pets.
- **Satellite view:** Reveals pools, solar panels, lot layout.
- **Physical inspection:** Only way to verify actual pride of ownership & conditions.

---

## üìù Common AM&C Checklist Items
1. Roof condition & age
2. Gutters & drainage
3. Exterior walls (stucco, siding, brick, etc.)
4. Walkways & trip hazards
5. Trees/vegetation clearance
6. Separate structures
7. Pools/fences
8. Foundation cracks / structural issues
9. Pride of ownership indicators

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Compliance Notes
- Agents can **bind coverage**, but **cannot cancel policies** ‚Äî only the company can.
- If a mistake occurs ‚Üí immediately contact **District Manager** and **Underwriting Manager**.
- Poor inspections may result in **adverse reports** or cancellation.

---

## üèîÔ∏è Colorado-Specific Notes
- Higher scrutiny in hail-prone ZIP codes (Front Range).
- Expect underwriting to focus on:
  - **Roof age/material** (5% WH deductible on non-arch/older roofs).
  - **Defensible space** for wildfire areas (Western Slope, foothills).
  - Trip hazards (sidewalks, cracked driveways) in urban zones.
- Colorado inspections often flag **vegetation near structures** due to fire risk.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- Always **inspect, inspect, inspect** ‚Äî never rely solely on Google photos.
- Errors in reporting (roof type, wall finish) = wrong rebuild estimate + possible cancellation.
- Document & upload 5+ photos minimum.
- Pride of ownership is a **predictor of future losses**.
- Colorado agents: Pay special attention to **hail & wildfire risks**.

‚ú® **Pro Tip:** If you wouldn‚Äôt insure it with your own money, don‚Äôt place it with Farmers.

## Colorado Quick‚ÄëReference (1‚Äëpage)

> Fast checklist you can print or screenshot. Use with **Fire 202 ‚Äì Inspecting Homes**.

### When to Inspect
- **Best practice:** Inspect **every** home you insure (street + backyard; inside if possible).
- **Smart Plan Home:** Agent inspection may be **required** based on answers (age/roof/materials). If required, **bind after photos** are uploaded and accepted.
- **CIS**: Farmers‚Äô third‚Äëparty inspectors generally visit **every new business** home. They submit data; **underwriting** decides.

### Photo Package (minimum 5)
- **Front & back** elevations
- **Both side** elevations (or one corner shot that clearly shows both)
- **Roof close‚Äëup** (material + condition)
- **Each separate structure** (pool, fence, deck, shed, solar array, dock, long runs of private power poles, etc.)
- Include **house number** in at least one shot

### Capture These Details (top agent misses)
- **Roof**: 3‚Äëtab vs **architectural/dimensional**; age; condition; pitch; complex/hip vs gable.
- **Exterior wall**: Brick/stone % mix (don‚Äôt mark ‚Äú100% brick‚Äù if there‚Äôs stone); stucco vs EIFS.
- **Pools/Hot tubs**: Fence/enclosure; diving boards/slides condition; deck trip hazards.
- **Sidewalks/driveways**: Heaving, gaps, trip hazards (esp. city walk in front).
- **Attractive nuisances**: Trampolines, tire swings over public areas, ninja rigs, unfenced swingsets on slopes.
- **Separate structures**: What, where, how used, rebuild cost; business use? off‚Äëpremises? (may need endorsement or is excluded).
- **Pride of ownership**: Peeling paint, sagging gutters/downspouts, vegetation on siding/roof.

### Inside Checks (if you can get in)
- **Water stains / prior damage** (ceilings, under sinks)
- **Electrical**: No fuse panels/knob‚Äëand‚Äëtube/aluminum branch wiring
- **Heat**: No primary wood‚Äëstove heat; clearances on secondary wood/pellet stoves
- **Plumbing**: No polybutylene; note PEX/copper/galv and age
- Evidence of **animals in quantity** or excessive wear

### Common Declines / Submit‚Äëfor‚ÄëApproval
- Major foundation movement (cracking, open separations)
- Vandalized/empty pools; **vinyl** pool covers used as safety covers
- Business on premises with hazardous ops (cabinet spray booth, welding, etc.)
- Exotic/wild animals
- Severe trip hazards / missing steps / open railings
- Improper chimneys (unsupported, ad‚Äëhoc bracing)

### Binding vs Cancellation (protect yourself)
- You **can bind**; you **cannot cancel**. If you bind in error, **call your DM and Underwriting** immediately‚Äîdocument everything.
- If CIS flags issues, **appeal to Underwriting** with your photos/context; corrections are possible.

### 360Value & Limits (reminders)
- Do **not** rely on prefill‚Äîcorrect stories, quality grade, exterior mix, roof type, corners.
- Average cost/ft¬≤ list sets **minimum** for **Guaranteed Replacement Cost** (GRC) in many states (not CA/AR). It is **not** the rebuild estimate.
- Customer is **contractually responsible** for limits and material facts; you‚Äôre their guide‚Äîdocument advisories.

### Colorado Tips
- Wildfire interface areas: look for **defensible space**, roof material, vents, vegetation against structures.
- Hail/wind corridors: give extra attention to **roof type/age**, complex roofs, and outbuildings.
- If an inspection looks borderline, **upload photos and notes before binding** and message UW in PolicyCenter.
