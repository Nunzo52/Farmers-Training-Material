# 🔥 Farmers Insurance Study Guide – Fire 201 (Part 2)

---

## 🏛️ Exclusive Agent vs Independent Agent
- **Exclusive Agents**: Responsibility is to the **carrier** (protect financial integrity of Farmers).  
- **Independent Agents**: Responsibility is to the **client**.  
- Be very cautious about actions and promises as an exclusive agent.  

---

## 💵 Coverage Limits & Rebuild Costs
- Farmers rebuild estimate might say **$300K**, but client may request **$450K**.  
- **Who chooses the limit?** → The **insured**.  
- Tools: **360 Value** provides estimated rebuild cost.  
- If client insists on higher coverage:  
  - Over **30% above estimate** → requires explanation & documentation (signed letter/email from client).  
  - Over **100% above estimate** → red flag, may require deeper review (possible fraud).  
- Documentation protects agent if DOI questions "over-insurance."

## 🌪️ Binding Authority & Catastrophes
- Binding authority **suspended** in disasters: hail, wildfire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake.  
- Restrictions vary by **zip code, state, and catastrophe declaration**.  
- Entire states can be restricted (e.g., East Coast hurricanes).  
- Example rules:  
  - **Earthquakes**:  
    - ≥5.0 magnitude → binding restricted within **50 miles** of epicenter.  
    - ≥6.0 magnitude → radius expands further.  
  - Use **USGS.gov** for real-time earthquake data (posted within seconds).  

---

## 🏚️ Foreclosures & Vacant Properties
- Extra caution: may be **vacant**, vandalized, or stripped.  
- Rules:  
  - Foreclosed OR vacant **≥30 days** → unacceptable until **submitted for approval**.  
  - Requires **interior photos** (kitchen, bathrooms, main rooms).  
- Common theft from foreclosures: copper piping, wiring, appliances, cabinets, sinks, tubs, light fixtures, windows.  
- Always **inspect & document condition** before binding.  

---

## 🛠️ Rebuilding Costs & 360 Value
- **Market Value ≠ Rebuild Cost**.  
- **Purchase price ≠ Rebuild Cost**.  
- Rebuild costs differ due to:  
  - Catastrophes raising lumber/sheetrock costs.  
  - Labor shortages.  
  - Unique building materials/features.  
- **360 Value** accuracy depends on **accurate input data**.  
  - Bad inputs → bad estimates.  
  - Example: $150K difference possible between correct vs incorrect data entry.  

---

## 🏗️ New Construction vs Reconstruction
- **New construction** is usually cheaper:  
  - Economies of scale (multiple homes at once).  
  - Open land, no parking/landscape restrictions.  
  - Easier contractor scheduling.  
- **Reconstruction** often more expensive:  
  - Site restrictions, demolition, unique finishes.  

---

## 🏡 Property Evaluations
- Critical data:  
  - Stories, roof type (3-tab vs architectural shingles).  
  - Exterior material (brick, siding, % mix).  
  - Pools, fencing, additions.  
- Use satellite & photo inspections for details.  

---

## 📊 Quarterly Rebuild Cost Tracking
- 360 Value issues **quarterly reports** on rebuild cost trends.  
- Costs fluctuate by region due to:  
  - Natural disasters (fires, floods, storms).  
  - Supply chain issues (lumber shortages).  
  - Local labor conditions.  
- Darker states on heat maps = higher cost increases.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways (Part 2)
- Insured **chooses the limit** (agent documents when exceeding estimate).  
- Binding authority suspended during **disasters & earthquakes**.  
- **Foreclosures/vacant homes** need inspection + approval.  
- **360 Value** depends on accurate data entry.  
- **Rebuild ≠ Market ≠ Purchase price**.  
- Reconstruction often costs more than new builds.  
- Stay updated with **360 Value quarterly reports** for cost changes.
