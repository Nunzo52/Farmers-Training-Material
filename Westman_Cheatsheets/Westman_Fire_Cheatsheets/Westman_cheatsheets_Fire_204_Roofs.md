## 🏠 Roofs — Shapes, Materials, Acceptability & Claims (All-in-One)

---

## 🧭 Why Roofs Matter
- Insurers pay more on **roof claims** than almost any other dwelling component (hail, wind, age).  
- Underwriting aims to **limit exposure** using: shape/material rules, age/condition thresholds, deductibles, endorsements, and inspection findings.  

---

## 🏗️ Roof **Shapes** (identify first)
Common menu (360Value): **Gable • Hip • Gambrel • Mansard • Flat • Shed • Complex Custom**  
- **Gable**: Triangular ends; wind can lift shingles at gable edges.  
- **Hip**: Slopes on all sides; **better in wind**, sometimes worse in hail.  
- **Gambrel (Dutch Colonial)**: Two slopes per side; often still **2-story** by floor‑area rule.  
- **Mansard**: Steep lower slope around perimeter.  
- **Flat / Shed**: Minimal slope; check cover compatibility; watch for torch‑down/rolled.  
- **Complex Custom**: Mix of hips/gables/dormers → higher build cost and more wind edges.  

🧮 **Stories vs. Height-to-Eave**  
- Determine stories from **front-door grade**.  
- Use **% of floor below**: `>70% = full story`, `40–70% = half story`, `<40% = attic`.  
- Basements **do not** count as stories (but full vs. shallow matters for cost).

## 🧱 Roof **Coverings & Materials**
Use 360Value **Roof Cover** library to match photos.

### Asphalt
- **3‑Tab Shingles**: Flat look; historically cheapest; fewer makers now → price gap narrowed.  
- **Architectural/Laminate**: Layered, thicker look; common default today.  
- Design patterns or color mixes are okay (doesn’t change cost class).

### Wood (Shakes/Shingles)
- State-specific rules; often require **% wind/hail deductibles** in hail belts.  
- Condition and local hazard (fire) heavily impact acceptability.

### Flat-Roof Systems
- **Rolled Roofing**: ❌ Often unacceptable (match/repair issues, blow‑off, leakage).  
- **Torch‑Down (Modified Bitumen)**: ✅ Often **OK in CA** if in good condition; ❌ not OK in many other states.  
- **BUR / Tar & Gravel**: ✅ Generally acceptable (built‑up roof; sometimes gravel‑surfaced).  
- **Membrane (single‑ply)**: ❌ Not allowed in **CA/NV** for dwellings; may be OK elsewhere per rules.

### Tile, Slate, Synthetics
- **Clay/Concrete/“Spanish” Tile**: ✅ Usually okay; verify actual flat roof beneath faux fronts.  
- **Slate**: ✅ Durable, hail‑resistant, **heavy** and **expensive**; copper gutters increase cost basis.  
- **Cement/Fiber/Synthetic Tiles**: ✅ Allowed; select best match in 360Value.

### Metal
- **Steel / Aluminum** standing seam or stamped panels: ✅ Often acceptable **outside** some hail‑heavy markets (e.g., parts of North Texas exclude).  
- **Copper / Tin**: ❌ **Do not insure**—soft metal dents/mars, expansion issues, high loss severity.  
- Mixed roofs: if metal feature ≥ **20%** of roof area → treat as metal for rules; <20% may be allowed **only** with strong pride‑of‑ownership.

### “Look‑Alike” Tricks
- Rolled products **printed** to look like shingles = still **rolled roofing** → ❌.  
- Faux tile on front with **flat/torch** on main deck → set predominant cover to **flat system**, not tile.

## 💥 Wind/Hail Deductibles & Out‑of‑Production Roofs

- Many states use **% wind/hail deductibles** (e.g., 1–2% typical; confirm your state grid).  
- **Out‑of‑Production (OOP)** roofs (e.g., **T‑Lock**) → **5% wind/hail** deductible: minor damage forces **full replacement** due to no matching.  
- Mortgagee clause may cap bank share for the large deductible on claim-driven replacements.


### 🇺🇸 Colorado — State‑Specific Deductible Notes
- **Wind/Hail (WH) Deductible**: Treat **2% of Coverage A** as the standard WH deductible across Colorado markets (per training guidance). Always confirm any carrier/territory exceptions in the current manual.
- **Out‑of‑Production Roofs (e.g., T‑Lock)**: **5% WH deductible** applies; minor damage can force full replacement due to matching/material availability.
- **Scheduled Roof Payment**: If the roof is already older at policy inception and subject to a schedule, roof **materials** are paid on **ACV** per schedule. This does **not** apply to **solar panels/skylights** (not categorized as “roof materials”).
- **Hail Belt Context**: Expect stricter scrutiny on **metal** (cosmetic marring, acceptance varies by territory), **layers**, and **condition**. Tie photos + satellite to your file notes.
- **Wildfire/Vegetation**: Separate from WH deductibles, Colorado has **tight defensible‑space** expectations—trees touching eaves/fascia are a **decline** trigger; clear that in your inspection notes.

## 🧱 Layers, Age & Condition
- **Multiple layers**: disliked; nails don’t grab deck; blow‑off risk; **teardown & disposal cost** ↑.  
  - **Texas**: usually **one layer max**; **never** wood-over-anything or shingles-over-wood.  
- **Red flags**: curling, missing tabs, lost granules, widespread patching, tar/gravel over shingles.  
- **Tree contact** with eaves/roof/fascia = ❌ decline (fire/wind/hail risks).  
- **Pride of ownership**: debris, peeling paint, unsafe railings, etc., correlate with loss frequency.

---

## 🛰️ Inspection Tactics
- Use **satellite** to verify shape, back buildings, flat sections, dormers.  
- Snow season: **bind with hold**; schedule post‑thaw roof inspection; cancel/non‑renew if fails.  
- In‑progress reroofs: underwriting may **exception‑approve** binding if completion is imminent (days).

---

## 🎛️ Endorsements & Claim Nuances
- **Cosmetic Marring** (dents/scratches/discoloration):  
  - Metal **roofs**: typically **excluded**; metal **roof materials** (valleys/vents) may be included.  
  - Some states offer a **marring endorsement** for non‑metal roofs (check manual).  
- **Scheduled Roof Payment**: Older roofs written today may be paid **ACV per schedule** on roof **materials** only.  
  - **Solar panels, skylights** are **not** “roof materials” → not subject to roof schedule.

---

## ☀️ Solar Panels
- **Owned or leased**: ✅ covered when **attached**; if lease doesn’t require coverage, still acceptable.  
- In 360Value, add under **Alternative Energy** and enter **system wattage**, not panel count.  
- **PV shingles (e.g., Tesla)**: treat as **Architectural** until a specific PV‑shingle option exists; different underlayment system.

---

## ✅ Accept / ❌ Decline — Quick Calls
**Accept** (if condition good & rules met):  
- Hip/gable/complex shapes with **sound** asphalt, tile, slate, steel/aluminum metal, BUR, torch‑down (per state).  
- Minor isolated shingle loss with overall good upkeep.  
- New reroof underway with **near‑term completion**.

**Decline / Submit Unbound**:  
- **Copper/tin** roofs; **rolled roofing** as main cover; **membrane** in CA/NV; **multiple layers** beyond rules.  
- **OOP** roofs without proper deductible; widespread granule loss; tarp repairs; vegetation‑covered roofs.  
- Trees touching the structure; unsafe conditions; poor pride‑of‑ownership signals.

---

## 📝 Field ID Cheat Codes
- **Architectural vs 3‑tab**: look for **shadowed/layered tabs**.  
- **Torch‑down vs rolled**: torch seams are **heat‑sealed**; rolled often **nailed** with exposed laps.  
- **Tile façade + flat main**: check satellite; set **predominant** cover to flat system.  
- **Gambrel 2‑story**: use **>70%** floor‑area rule despite low eaves.  
- **Copper gutters/bells** hint at **premium build** → adjust values (and look for sprinklers).  
- **Skylight build‑ups/patches**: verify workmanship; note water intrusion risks.

---

## 🔍 Submission Notes (360Value / File)
- Set **Roof Shape** and **Roof Cover** precisely; list **percent splits** if mixed.  
- Note **age**, **layers**, **condition**, **any OOP material**, **deductible grid**, and **endorsements**.  
- Document **photos** (street + satellite), tree proximity, and any **active reroof** timeline.

---

## ✅ Quick Reference Checklist
- [ ] Identify **shape** (gable/hip/gambrel/mansard/flat/shed/complex).  
- [ ] Select **covering** with photos (+ predominant if mixed).  
- [ ] Check **age/condition/layers**; look for curling, missing tabs, granule loss.  
- [ ] Apply correct **wind/hail deductible**; flag **OOP** materials (5% WH).  
- [ ] Verify **state-specific** bans (e.g., membrane in CA/NV; metals in hail belts).  
- [ ] Evaluate **pride of ownership**; trees clear of eaves/fascia.  
- [ ] Add **solar** under Alternative Energy (enter **watts**).  
- [ ] Note **endorsements** (cosmetic marring where available).  
- [ ] Attach **photos** & satellite; document any **re-roof** schedule.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Roof acceptability is 50% material/shape and 50% **condition + context**. If anything looks **non‑standard** or **marginal**, pause, document, and run it **unbound** to underwriting.
