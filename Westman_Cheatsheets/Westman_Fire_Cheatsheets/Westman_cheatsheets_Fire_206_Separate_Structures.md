# üî• Westman Cheatsheets ‚Äî Fire 206: Separate Structures

_A field-ready, colorful reference for identifying, classifying, and underwriting separate structures._

---

## üèóÔ∏è What Counts as a Separate Structure?
- **Definition:** ‚ÄúSet apart from the dwelling by clear space.‚Äù  
- üö´ NOT separate if connected by same roofline / common wall.  
- ‚úÖ Still separate if only connected by: sidewalk, wire, plumbing, fence, patio.

**Examples:**  
- Detached garage  
- Fence  
- Driveway  
- Pergola, patio, pool deck, greenhouse  
- Pool, dock, wharf, spa  
- Power poles on premises (carrying power to home)  
- Solar arrays **bolted to ground** (not on roof)

---

## üìù Key Questions to Ask
1. **Use:** What‚Äôs it being used for? (personal storage, business, rental?)  
2. **Capacity:** How many cars (if garage)? How many sq. ft.?  
3. **Rebuild Cost:** What would it cost to replace?  

---

## üö´ Business Use Rules
- **HO Policy Excludes:** Separate structures ‚Äúused in business.‚Äù  
- üõ†Ô∏è Storage of business property = concern if it‚Äôs the **principal use**.  
- ‚ùå Cabinetmaking shop, landscaping trailers, manufacturing = decline.  
- ‚úÖ Low-impact home businesses (piano lessons, tutoring) only if endorsed ‚ÄúBusiness on Premises.‚Äù  
- ‚ùå Renting structure to someone else for their business = excluded.

---

## üõë Attractive Nuisances
- Swing sets over sidewalks or on slopes ‚Üí major liability hazard.  
- Treehouses rented on Airbnb ‚Üí excluded (business + unusual risk).  
- Pools & trampolines ‚Üí must be fenced or rural exception.  
- Exotic pets (pythons, lions, etc.) ‚Üí unacceptable.  
- Pools: require fence or **metal cover**.  
  - ‚ùå Vinyl covers are dangerous (kids run on them ‚Üí fall through).  
  - Diving boards & slides must be in **good repair**.

---

## üèä Pools & Hot Tubs
- ‚úÖ Acceptable: fenced pools, rural/private pools invisible from public view, above-ground if fenced.  
- ‚ùå Not acceptable: unfenced pools (unless rural w/ privacy), empty pools, unsafe covers.  
- Hot tubs ‚Üí same rules (fenced or rural exception).  
- Decking: trip hazards, loose tiles = decline until repaired.

---

## ‚ö° Utilities as Separate Structures
- Power poles & lines **on premises** ‚Üí separate structures.  
- Wind turbines, solar arrays on ground-mounted racks ‚Üí separate structures.  
- Off-premises (e.g., boat dock 100 yards away) ‚Üí **not covered** unless state has special endorsement.

---

## üßæ State Endorsement Reminder
Some states allow ‚ÄúSeparate Structures Off Premises‚Äù endorsements (‚âà 8 states).  
- Must be within declared coverage; check underwriting if in doubt.  
- **California Smart Plan:** auto 10% Coverage A (modifiable $).  
- **Other states:** 5%‚Äì200% Coverage A; justify if unusually high.

## üèîÔ∏è Colorado ‚Äî State‚ÄëSpecific Notes on Separate Structures & Deductibles
- **Wind/Hail Deductible:** Most structures (including garages, sheds, and fences) follow the **2% of Coverage A** WH deductible rule. Out‚Äëof‚Äëproduction roofs (on separate structures) ‚Üí **5% WH deductible** applies.  
- **Hail Belt Scrutiny:** Inspect **metal outbuildings, sheds, and detached garages** carefully for cosmetic vs. functional damage; acceptance varies by carrier/territory.  
- **Wildfire Exposure:**  
  - Separate structures (e.g., sheds, play structures, woodpiles) within **30 feet of the dwelling** raise defensible‚Äëspace issues.  
  - Trees/vegetation overhanging **detached garages** or sheds = red flag.  
- **Pool/Trampoline Context:** In CO, **fencing requirements** are strict: pools and trampolines visible from public roads w/out fencing ‚Üí almost always decline.  
- **Coverage B Percentages:** In CO Smart Plan HO, default = **10% Coverage A**. Agents can increase up to 200% for structures (but must justify with rebuild costs).

## ‚úÖ Quick Reference Table
| Item | Likely OK | Needs Fix/Endorsement | Likely Decline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detached garage | Personal use | Converted to living/business | Business shop under living space |
| Pool | Fenced/rural | Deck hazards, repair needed | Unfenced urban, empty pool |
| Trampoline | Backyard, fenced | Rural/gated exception | Front yard, visible, unfenced |
| Greenhouse/shed | Personal gardening | Storage of minor sales goods | Business inventory storage |
| Power poles/lines | On-premises | Old/unstable, doc cost | Off-premises |
| Solar array | Roof- or ground-mounted | ‚Äî | On non-resident premises |

## üó£Ô∏è Field Phrases
- ‚ÄúIs this structure being used for business or storage of business property?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúCoverage depends on how this is being used‚Äîcan you clarify?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWe can endorse piano lessons or tutoring; we can‚Äôt endorse cabinetmaking.‚Äù

üí° **Bottom Line:** Always ask about **use**. If business, rental, or unusual exposure ‚Üí likely decline unless endorsed and approved. Document everything with photos & inspector notes.

## Colorado-Specific Notes ‚Äî Deductibles & Separate Structures (Coverage B)

> These notes reflect common CO market practice. Always confirm the exact language on the quote, declarations, and endorsements for your carrier.

**1) Wind/Hail (W/H) percentage deductibles are common on the Front Range**  
- Many Colorado HO policies use a separate W/H deductible expressed as a % of Coverage A (often 0.5%‚Äì5%).  
- Unless the policy says otherwise, losses to **Coverage B separate structures** (fences, sheds, detached garages, pools, docks, pergolas, driveways, retaining walls, solar arrays, etc.) **use the same W/H deductible** and the % is still calculated from **Coverage A**, even when only Coverage B is damaged.  
- The W/H deductible is **per-occurrence**, not per structure.

**Quick math example**  
- Cov A = $600,000; W/H deductible = 2% ‚Üí $12,000 deductible.  
- Hail damages only a detached garage roof (Cov B). The deductible is still $12,000 (2% of Cov A), unless the policy has a different rule.

**2) All-Peril vs. Special W/H deductible**  
- If the policy has both an **All-Peril** deductible (flat dollar) and a **separate W/H %** deductible, the **higher applicable deductible** typically governs hail/wind claims.  
- Some carriers allow a **flat W/H deductible** instead of a percentage‚Äîverify which one is selected on the quote.

**3) Cosmetic damage & roof endorsements (increasingly used in CO)**  
- Many carriers file **Cosmetic Damage Exclusions** for metal roofs/siding‚Äîdents from hail without a leak or functional failure may be excluded.  
- **Roof surfacing/ACV endorsements** may settle older roof surfaces at ACV. These can apply to **Coverage B roofs** too (sheds, detached garages, pool houses). Confirm age triggers & materials.  
- If you install **Class 4 impact-resistant** shingles on detached structures, ask for the **IR credit** and make sure those roofs are **scheduled or clearly included** so the discount/coverage applies.

**4) Matching & line-of-sight**  
- Colorado doesn‚Äôt guarantee ‚Äúmatching.‚Äù Many policies limit replacement to **damaged** portions only. If a hail repair on a fence/panel won‚Äôt match, that‚Äôs typically not a basis for replacing undamaged sections unless the policy or an endorsement says so. Clarify expectations during quoting.

**5) Wildfire considerations (deductibles & mitigation)**  
- Separate wildfire deductibles are less common than W/H, but some carriers may use **catastrophe or tiered deductibles**.  
- Underwriting may require **defensible space** and vegetation management around **separate structures** (sheds, fences attached to decks, wood piles, pergolas). Non‚Äëcompliance can impact insurability or claim outcomes (e.g., compliance conditions).

**6) Off‚Äëpremises separate structures**  
- Coverage B normally requires the structure to be **on the residence premises**. If an insured owns a dock/boathouse or ag building **off‚Äëlot**, check for a **state-filed endorsement** or a commercial/farm solution. Don‚Äôt assume Coverage B extends off premises.

**7) Scheduling higher Coverage B limits**  
- In CO you can usually **increase Coverage B as a % of Coverage A** (and sometimes add a dollar rider). For high‚Äëvalue outbuildings (large detached garages, shop/barns, solar arrays), **raise Coverage B** and document the replacement cost.  
- Remember the **W/H % deductible still references Coverage A** unless the policy states otherwise.

**8) Claims tip for fences, flatwork & hardscape**  
- Hail can pit/stain **driveways, patios, pool decks**‚Äîthese are Coverage B items and will be subject to the same deductible logic.  
- For long fence runs, note that adjusters may pay by **damaged lineal feet** only; matching issues or HOA aesthetic requirements may require an endorsement or higher limits to avoid surprises.

**Agent checklist (CO)**  
- [ ] Confirm **W/H deductible type and %**, and whether it applies to Coverage B.  
- [ ] Review **cosmetic damage** and **roof ACV** endorsements for **all detached roofs**.  
- [ ] Verify any **impact‚Äëresistant credits** apply to **detached** structures where applicable.  
- [ ] Inspect & note **defensible space** and combustibles near outbuildings (wildfire).  
- [ ] Validate whether any **separate structures are off‚Äëpremises**‚Äîsolve with proper endorsements or a different policy form.  
- [ ] Right‚Äësize **Coverage B limits** to actual rebuild costs of outbuildings/hardscape/solar.
