## 🏠 Why Floaters Exist (Problem → Solution)  
- 🔒 **Base HO/Renters/Condo special limits** cap recovery on theft-prone classes (esp. **jewelry**).  
- 💰 **Smart Plan Home base theft limit:** $1,000 per item | $2,500 aggregate.  
- ❌ **Mysterious Disappearance (MD)** excluded on base forms → ✅ must add **Scheduled Floater**.  
- 🔥 Fire & other covered perils = **Coverage C** (RC/ACV rules), not theft sublimits.  

---

## 🔼 Three Primary Ways to Boost Coverage  

### 🟢 A) Increase Special Limits (Endorsement)  
- 📈 Raises caps inside policy (ex: jewelry theft). Requires **Premier** (or **NextGen HO**).  
- 💍 Jewelry max: **$12,500 aggregate** (still $2,500/item). Does **not** add MD.  
- 💻 Other classes: computers, silver, guns, securities → up to **$75,000** combined.  
- 🧾 Deductible = follows base policy deductible.  

### 🟡 B) Unscheduled Personal Articles (UPA)  
- 📦 Blanket pool for jewelry + “other” (stamps, coins, silver, fine arts).  
- 🔎 Per-item cap: **$2,500**. No appraisal needed.  
- ❌ **MD not covered.**  
- 💵 Deductible: lesser of base deductible or $500.  

### 🔵 C) Scheduled Personal Articles (SPA / Floater)  
- 📝 Itemized, broadest option. Adds **MD + accidental breakage**.  
- 💎 Min: $1,500/item. Std Max: $50,000/item (UW can approve higher). Aggregate: $100,000+.  
- ⚖️ Deductibles: $0–$2,500 (applies across schedule).  
- 🟢 Agreed Value: locks payout at schedule amount → higher cost, no disputes.  
- 🆕 Newly acquired items: 25% of schedule | Max $10,000 | 30 days auto-coverage.

## 📋 Documentation & Binding Rules  
- 📜 $1,500–$5,000 → receipt OK.  
- 📜 $5,001–$10,000 → appraisal ≤5 years.  
- 📜 $10,000+ → appraisal ≤3 years (+ photo).  
- ❌ Don’t bind damaged goods (chips, broken prongs).  
- 👀 Inspect & scan docs promptly.  
- 🟢 Agreed Value = requires proper appraisal.

## 🏡 Policy-Type Nuances  
- **Smart Plan Home (SPH):**  
  - Base theft: $1,000/item | $2,500 total.  
  - 📉 Standard Endorsement → limits jewelry theft to $1,000 total.  
  - 📈 Premier Endorsement → $1,500/item | $5,000 aggregate.  
- **NextGen HO (CA):** theft limits similar to Premier.  
- **Legacy Renters:** theft limit often $500 total.  
- **Smart Plan Renters/Condo:** broader, floaters allowed.  
- 🔑 Theft sublimits = **theft only**. Fire = Coverage C rules.

## 🌍 Perils, Exclusions & Territory  
- ❌ MD excluded on base → ✅ SPA adds it.  
- 🎨 Fine arts on display (library, museum, fair) = **not covered** → should rely on exhibitor.  
- 🌎 Territory: varies by form.  
  - Western Hemisphere (older firearm wording).  
  - Continental US & Canada (fine arts limits).  
  - SPA: “anywhere in world,” with standard exclusions (war, nuclear, etc.).  
- 💼 Business use:  
  - 🎶 Instruments: ✅ if Business Use = Yes box checked.  
  - 📷 Cameras: 🚫 typically excluded if professional → use commercial.  

---

## 💍 Engagement Ring & Insurable Interest  
- SPA requires **ownership**.  
- Once ring is given, ownership → fiancé(e).  
- Exception: may add fiancé(e) as named insured on **renters policy** (not HO) to schedule ring (verify UW).  

---

## 🎶 Instruments, 📷 Cameras, 🔫 Firearms  
- **Musical Instruments:** great SPA fit. Add “Business Use” if gigging. Claims = drop, spill, damage.  
- **Cameras:** SPA covers drops, cracks. 🚫 No pro use. Agents must screen real estate / pro photographers.  
- **Firearms:** lawful only. Cases/ammo included. No illegal/paramilitary. Gun safes 🔐 recommended but not required.  

---

## 💵 Pricing Snapshot  
- 🔹 Increase limits = cheapest (narrowest).  
- 🔸 UPA = mid-range (no MD).  
- 🔺 SPA = most expensive (adds MD, breakage, agreed value).  

---

## ⚡ Claims Scenarios  
1. 💍 $8,500 ring lost in **fire** (no floater): Coverage C pays RC/ACV, not theft limit.  
2. 💍 $8,500 ring **stolen** on base SPH: $1,000/item | $2,500 total.  
3. 💎 Stone falls out (MD):  
   - Base / UPA / Increase Limits → ❌ No.  
   - SPA → ✅ Yes.  

---

## ✅ Sales & Service Checklist  
- 🔎 ID base policy form.  
- 📈 Confirm client’s theft + MD concerns.  
- 🛠️ Choose Increase Limits / UPA / SPA accordingly.

## 🏔️ Colorado-Specific Notes  
- 🌪️ Separate wind/hail deductibles common (often % of Coverage A).  
- 🪟 Roof schedule endorsements required (per 2019 DOI regs).  
- 💍 Jewelry floaters often need updated appraisals for full payout disputes.  
- 📌 Agents should disclose roof schedule/wind-hail deductibles when adding floaters.
