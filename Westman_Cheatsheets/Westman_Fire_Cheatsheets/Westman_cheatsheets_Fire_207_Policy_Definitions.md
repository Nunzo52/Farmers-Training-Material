🎯 # Fire 207 Policy Definitions
_Last updated: 2025-09-03 20:28 UTC_

💡 Source: instructor talk-through on drones, insured locations, who is an insured, rescission, home businesses, incidental activity, earth movement, and vacancy (Smart Plan HO context).

🔹 ## Quick Index
> ✦ Drones / aircraft
> ✦ Insured location (residence, temp residence, vacant land, construction, cemetery, event rentals)
> ✦ Who is an insured (you/spouse, relatives, kids in care, students, caretakers)
> ✦ Rescission basics
> ✦ Business at home & short‑term rentals
> ✦ Incidental economic activity (garage sale, lemonade, kids’ jobs)
> ✦ Earth movement exclusion
> ✦ Vacancy definition & penalties

---

🔹 ## Drones / Aircraft
> ✦ **Hobby RC** (planes/helis) ≠ “aircraft” under HO **unless a government agency deems it an aircraft** (city/county/state/federal).
> ✦ **Drones** are widespread (millions; many FAA registrations). Coverage for hull + liability usually needs a **stand‑alone drone policy**.
> ✦ Always **ask** about drones; if client declines coverage, **document in writing**.

---

🔹 ## Insured Location (IL)
The contract lists multiple ILs:
1. **Residence premises** – dwelling, other structures, grounds at dec page address.  
2. **Other premises shown** or **acquired during policy period** **for your use as a private residence** (auto temp extension, then must be listed).  
3. **Temporary residence** you don’t own (hotel, rented summer place, relative’s home).  
4. **Vacant land** (non‑farm/ranch) you own; co‑owned land should be **listed on each owner’s policy**.  
5. **Land you own/rent where a 1–2 family dwelling is being built** **as your private residence** (spec homes not included).  
6. **Cemetery plots** – mainly extends **liability** (e.g., slip/fall, headstone issues).  
7. **Premises occasionally rented** to you **other than for business use**, and **only while you are actually renting it** (e.g., Elks Club/church/Country Club for a wedding).

**Events at rented venues:** Your HO gives **limited** protection and only for **you**. Venue damage, guest injuries, liquor exposure, etc., are best handled by a **special event policy** (often a few hundred dollars).

---

🔹 ## Who Is an Insured
> ✦ **“You/your”** = **named insured** on dec page **and** resident **spouse/domestic partner**.
> ✦ Always list **both spouses** as named insureds (control, changes/cancel, claims/indemnity checks; avoids separation/move‑out gaps).
> ✦ **Relatives** (blood/marriage/adoption) who are **permanent residents** of your household.
> ✦ **Other persons under 21 in your care** (foster kids, exchange students, neighbor’s child living with you).
> ✦ **Students away at school** are insured if **full‑time** (as defined by the school), **under 24**, and were **permanent residents before moving out**.
> ✦ Strongly consider a **separate renters policy** for the student (protects their stuff & liability, and keeps parents’ loss history clean).
> ✦ **Persons legally responsible for your animals/watercraft** (e.g., neighbor kid walking your dog) are insured **unless done in business**.
> ✦ **Professional dog walker** = **business** → not an insured; should carry business coverage.

---

🔹 ## Rescission (Void Ab Initio)
Carrier may rescind (treat as if policy never existed) for material issues such as:  
> ✦ **No insurable interest** (e.g., putting mom as HO insured on a home owned by son who rents it to her – should be **landlord** + mom’s **renters**).
> ✦ **Undisclosed business on premises** (salon, welding, photo studio, Airbnb).
> ✦ **Undisclosed major renovations.**
Rescission is worse than cancellation (premium returned; **no coverage** during the period).

---

🔹 ## Business at Home
> ✦ **Business** = any economic undertaking for money (profit or loss; full/part‑time; seasonal; products/services).
> ✦ **Business property sublimits** (Smart Plan HO typical): **$1,500 on premises**, **$500 off premises**; **inventory excluded**.
> ✦ Certain **teaching/tutoring (e.g., piano)** exposures can sometimes be endorsed, but it’s still a **business**.
> ✦ **Short‑term rentals (Airbnb/VRBO, room/entire home)** = **business**. Use appropriate **host/landlord/specialty** coverage; HO often won’t respond to guest‑caused fire/injury/assault/bedbugs/drowning, etc.

### Incidental & Infrequent Personal Economic Activity
> ✦ Not a “business” when **incidental and infrequent** (both): one‑off garage/yard sale, hobby sales, true volunteer activities (no profit beyond expenses for a 501(c)(3)).
> ✦ If you do sales **regularly** (e.g., monthly Craigslist/eBay flips) → **business**.
> ✦ **Kids under 18** doing typical jobs (babysitting, lawn mowing, lemonade stands) → **not** a business; hiring crews/markups could cross into **business**.

---

🔹 ## Earth Movement (Excluded Perils)
> ✦ **Any movement of earth** is excluded: landslide, mudslide/mudflow, earthquake (separately defined), erosion, sinking, rising, shifting, shearing, vibrating, settling, cracking, **volcanic activity**, etc.
> ✦ Applies whether **natural or man‑made** (construction vibration, water line breaks, etc.).
> ✦ For this peril, coverage (if desired) needs a **DIC (Difference in Conditions)** or other specialty policy.

**Real‑world claims noted:** complete hillside failures; homes sliding; courts upholding earth‑movement exclusions despite sympathy. Precedent & rating concerns limit carriers’ ability to “goodwill” pay excluded perils.

---

🔹 ## Vacancy
**Vacant** when **both** are true:
1. No one is **legally using** the dwelling as their **principal** place of abode, **and**  
2. A **predominant amount of personal property** has been removed.

**Key applications**
> ✦ **Staged homes**: furniture belongs to staging biz → not your personal property → still **vacant**.
> ✦ **Night sitters** hired by staging company: not their **principal** abode → still **vacant**.
> ✦ **Penalties** kick in after time thresholds:
> ✦ **>30 days**: **theft excluded**.
> ✦ **>60 days**: **vandalism/malicious mischief (incl. arson) excluded**.
> ✦ **Under active construction**: specifically **not** considered vacant.
> ✦ **Newly purchased dwelling (not under construction)**: deemed **vacant until legally occupied**.

**Best practice**
> ✦ If moving out / delayed move‑in, place a **vacant dwelling policy** (30/60/90/6‑mo terms common).
> ✦ Always **disclose** vacancy and **document** carrier guidance.

---

🔹 ## Producer Playbook (Do/Document)
> ✦ Ask targeted questions (drones, other premises, vacant land, home biz, short‑term rental, students).
> ✦ Classify the exposure → choose correct policy/endorsement.
> ✦ If client declines coverage, **confirm via email**.
> ✦ Coverage gray areas: **consult Claims leadership** for interpretations and **record** the guidance.

🔹 ## Colorado Quick-Reference (2024–2025 Updates)

> ✦ **FAIR Plan (last resort)** – Colorado launched a FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) Plan in **2024** to provide basic property coverage for homeowners who cannot secure insurance in the private market (e.g., wildfire-prone areas). It should be considered a **last-resort option**, with limited coverages and higher premiums.
> ✦ **Wildfire Mitigation & Discounts** – Insurers in CO must recognize homeowners’ wildfire mitigation work (defensible space, Class A roofing, ember-resistant vents, etc.) when pricing coverage. Always **document mitigation** for underwriting and premium credits.
> ✦ **Short-Term Rentals** – Colorado cities (Denver, Boulder, mountain resort towns) often require **permits and $1M+ liability coverage** for Airbnb/VRBO hosts. These exposures are **business use** and **not covered under standard HO**. Place them on a landlord/host form.
> ✦ **Drone Restrictions** – Colorado follows federal FAA rules (Remote ID effective 2024) and allows local municipalities/parks to ban drone takeoff/landing. Drones are often excluded under HO; use a **stand-alone drone policy**.
> ✦ **Vacancy** – CO follows the **standard HO 30/60-day vacancy exclusions** (theft excluded after 30, vandalism/arson after 60). Specialty **vacant dwelling coverage** is required; some carriers will bind as short as **30 days**.
> ✦ **Earth Movement** – High-risk in Colorado’s mountain counties (mudflows, landslides). HO excludes this entirely. Coverage may be available via **DIC policies** or, for mudflow tied to flooding, through NFIP flood insurance.
> ✦ **Event Liability** – Venues in CO (wineries, lodges, clubs) often require additional insured wording and primary/non-contributory language. Recommend a **special event policy** whenever insureds rent a hall/club/church.
