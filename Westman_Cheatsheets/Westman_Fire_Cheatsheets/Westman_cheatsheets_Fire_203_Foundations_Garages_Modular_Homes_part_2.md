# 🎓 Westman Cheatsheets: Fire 203

## 🏠 Foundations, Garages, Modular Homes (Part 2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🪑 Porches

-   ✅ **Definition**: Must fit **two chairs + one small table**\
-   🚫 **NOT a Porch**: Just a cover or small entry step area\
-   📌 **Porch Square Footage**: NOT included in living space
    calculation\
-   🔎 Foundation check: Porches usually lack true foundation support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏠 Split-Level & Bi-Level Homes

-   **Split-Level / Bi-Level**: Entry at mid-level, steps up and down to
    different floors\
-   Interchangeable terms\
-   ➕ Square footage in rear extensions must be included\
-   ⚠️ Incorrect classification → inflated rebuild cost

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏝️ Homes on Stilts & Pilings

🚫 Generally **unacceptable** due to risks:\
- 🌊 Flooding & shifting foundations\
- 🔥 Higher fire cleanup costs (environmental, estuaries, protected
land)\
- 🛠️ Stability hazards

🔒 **Rare Exceptions** (e.g., Texas Gulf, Alabama):\
1. Must be insured for **100% flood coverage**\
2. Must comply with **Texas Wind Insurance Authority** building codes\
3. Must carry **TX 160 Endorsement** (excludes windstorm, cyclone, hail)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛑 Acceptability Red Flags (Revisited)

-   🚪 Doors without permanent barriers\
-   🪜 6+ steps without railing\
-   🏗️ Decks without railings → automatic decline\
-   🔥 Firewood stacked by house = ⚠️ concern but not always a decline

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚗 Garages

-   Three types only:
    -   None\
    -   Attached\
    -   Detached\
-   🏠 **Built-In Garage** = integrated into main structure (different
    cost factor than attached)\
-   🚙 Carports = **not garages** (lack walls; detached = separate
    structure)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏚️ Attics vs. Half Stories

-   Use **height-to-eave ratio** + % floor space above\

-   \<40% = attic\

-   40--70% = half story\

-   70% = full story

-   🌀 Dormers may create half-story situations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏘️ Modular Homes

-   🏭 Built **off-site in factory modules**\
-   🚚 Moved **once** to foundation → permanent residence\
-   ✅ Stick-built quality (sheetrock, wiring, taped walls)\
-   ❌ **Not** manufactured/mobile homes (those are on frames, movable
    later)\
-   📌 Must be inspected by CIS\
-   🚫 Reject if built only to **HUD emergency standards** (lower fire
    ratings, plastic cabinets, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏚️ Unusual Construction or Design

🚫 Not acceptable due to rebuild cost issues & lack of contractors:\
- 🏠 Geodesic domes\
- 🧱 Straw bale homes\
- 🕳️ Underground / earth-sheltered homes (except limited backfill
homes)\
- 🌱 Vegetation-covered roofs\
- 🪟 Fiberglass houses (obsolete, unreplaceable parts)\
- 🌊 Over-water homes\
- 🏚️ Tiny homes (except as separate detached structures, not primary
residences)\
- 📦 Shipping container homes (no reliable rebuild data yet)\
- 🌳 Treehouses (ok as detached structure, ❌ never primary residence)\
- 🏗️ Steel houses or non-standard designs (rare, non-replicable)\
- 🏠 Glass houses (underwriting approval required)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ Quick Reference Checklist (Part 2)

-   [ ] Verify porch (2 chairs + table rule)\
-   [ ] Classify split-level / bi-level homes correctly\
-   [ ] Reject stilts/pilings unless exception criteria met\
-   [ ] Check garage type (attached/detached/built-in)\
-   [ ] Distinguish attic vs. half story using 40/70% rule\
-   [ ] Modular homes → factory-built, permanent foundation, CIS
    inspection\
-   [ ] Watch for unusual/non-replicable construction → 🚫 decline

------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 **Pro Tip**: If you see anything "non-standard" (unusual design,
movable structures, experimental materials) → 🚫 decline unless
underwriting approves.
