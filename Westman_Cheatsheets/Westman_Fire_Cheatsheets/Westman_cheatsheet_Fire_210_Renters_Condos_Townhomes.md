## 🎯 Why Renters Insurance Is Overlooked

**Common reasons people don’t buy renters insurance:**  
- 🙈 *They don’t think they need it* → “Nothing will happen to me.”  
- 💸 *Think it’s too expensive* (in reality, often like the cost of a 🍕 pizza per month).  
- 🙃 *Don’t know what it covers* (loss of use, liability, guest medical, contents).  
- 🛑 *Agent never asks* → missed opportunity.  
- 🚫 *Disqualified* (claims history, location issues).  
- 🤷 *Assume landlord covers them* (false).  

**Colorado Note:** Many landlords in Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins now **require renters insurance**, but follow-up enforcement is often weak. Agents should recommend landlords be listed for cancellation notice.

## 📚 Educating Customers

- Use **local news stories** of apartment fires/floods to show exposure.  
- Explain **loss of use**: apartment burns → they still owe rent, must find new housing.  
- Emphasize **liability**: dog bite, slip & fall, toilet overflow into neighbor’s unit.  

**Example Claim:** 3rd-floor toilet overflows → water damages electronics downstairs → liability claim.  

---

## 👯 Roommates & Policies

- If **all roommates on the lease** → can write one policy, but…  
  - Only one liability limit shared.  
  - One jewelry/theft sublimit shared.  
  - Claims history gets linked.  
- If **not on the lease** → considered **roomers/borders** → must carry own policy.  
- Better practice = **separate policies** → cleaner liability, discounts, and loss of use.

## 📦 Coverage & Inventory

- Families often underestimate value (clothes, furniture, electronics, hobbies).  
- Suggest **video walk-throughs** 📱 of belongings.  
- Adjusters require itemized details for total fire losses.  
- High-value items (jewelry, art, instruments, firearms) may need **floaters**.  

**Colorado Note:** Mountain towns = high incidence of **theft of outdoor gear** (skis, bikes). Remind clients of sublimits.

## 🏢 Special Property Types

- ✅ Rented houses, apartments, manufactured homes.  
- ✅ Nursing homes/assisted living units.  
- ✅ Dorms, fraternities/sororities.  
- ❌ Travel trailers (covered by Foremost Specialty).  

**Real Claim Example:** Student broke dorm sprinkler → $64,000 in water damage. Liability triggered.

## 🚪 Loss of Use & Civil Authority

- Standard = **20% of Coverage C (contents)**.  
- Covers: hotel, meals, transportation, storage, Comcast hookups.  
- **Civil Authority** = 14 days if city orders evacuation (wildfire, smoke, etc.).  
- Better: Increase limits for long-term displacement.  

**Colorado Note:** After Marshall Fire (2021), many renters **ran out of loss of use coverage** months before rebuilds finished. Agents should recommend higher limits.

## 🛠️ Condos vs. Townhomes

### Condos 🏢  
- HOA covers **roof, foundation, weight-bearing walls, exterior**.  
- Unit owner covers **walls-in finishes, built-ins, flooring, cabinets, appliances**.  
- 50/50 rule: Half structure = HOA, half = owner.  
- Must review **master policy** (some only cover original finishes).  

### Townhomes 🏘️  
- Essentially **homeowners policies**.  
- Owner owns dirt + structure.  
- Difference = **shared walls** → rebuild cost adjusted by 360Value.  

**Colorado Note:** Many Colorado condo HOAs have **very high deductibles ($10K–$25K per unit)**. Advise clients to carry **Loss Assessment coverage**.  

---

## ⚖️ Liability Highlights

- Fire legal liability: covers **damage to rented unit only for fire/smoke/explosion**.  
- Roommates must have separate liability.  
- Assisted living residents → still need liability for guest falls, oxygen tanks, etc.  

**Colorado Note:** Renters in ski towns (Aspen, Breck, Vail) often face **short-term rental sublets** → exposure increases. Must clarify occupancy with underwriting.  

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Renters often underestimate risk. Educate with **real-life scenarios**.  
- Separate policies for roommates = **best practice**.  
- Condos require **master policy review**.  
- Townhomes = HO policy with adjusted rebuild cost.  
- For Colorado:  
  - High deductibles on condos → recommend **Loss Assessment**.  
  - Marshall Fire showed **loss of use underinsurance**.  
  - Theft of outdoor gear is a frequent claim → highlight sublimits.
