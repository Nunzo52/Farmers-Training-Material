# 📘 Fire 201 Binding Authority Part 1
*(Smart Plan Home vs. Next-Gen Home, Binding Authority, High-Value Homes)*  

---

## 🔹 1. Claims & Coverage Basics
- ✅ Farmers **can** write a check for the **full replacement cost** in clear total loss situations.  
- ⚠️ Always align coverage with **Rebuild Cost** (not purchase price or market value).  
- 🏚️ *Loss of Use*: Farmers extended CA wildfire claims from **24 → 36 months**.  

---

## 🔹 2. Policy Forms: Smart Plan Home vs. Next-Gen
- First step in any claim/coverage question → identify **which policy form** is active.  
- Different forms = different sublimits (jewelry, theft, food spoilage, etc.).  
- Mistakes occur when reading the wrong form.  

---

## 🔹 3. Binding Authority
- Authority up to **$3M (rebuild cost)**.  
- Binding is **not tied** to purchase price, assessor value, or Zillow.  
- Homes **>$1M** → require photos:  
  - Kitchen  
  - Master Bedroom  
  - Entryway  
  - All exterior sides + roof + pool/structures  

---

## 🔹 4. Rebuild Cost Drivers
- 🪵 **Materials**: lumber, drywall, roofing, appliances.  
- 👷 **Labor**: wage changes, contractor shortages.  
- 📜 **Building Codes**: ordinance/law updates.  
- 💵 **Permits/fees**: often rise.  
- 🌪️ **Catastrophes**: disasters increase demand/prices.  
- ⛽ **Transportation costs**: fuel prices impact rebuild.  

---

## 🔹 5. Extended / Guaranteed Replacement Cost
- Adds **125%, 150%, or Guaranteed Replacement** buffer.  
- Protects client *and* agent from low estimates.  

---

## 🔹 6. High-Value Homes & Specialty Placement
- **>$3M rebuild** → must go to **Craft Lake or High-Net-Worth carriers** (Chubb, AIG, PURE, Nationwide PCG).  
- ❌ Farmers will not insure:  
  - Homes on the **National Historic Registry**.  
  - **Course of Construction >$1M**.  
- HNW markets = art, wine, jewelry floaters + umbrellas up to **$50M**.  

---

## 🔹 7. Public Protection Class (PPC) Rules
**Examples by state:**  
- WA: 1–6 eligible (7+ not)  
- UT: 1–6 eligible (7 not)  
- MN: 1–7 eligible (8+ not)  
- TX: 1–4 eligible (5+ not)  
- IL: 1–7 eligible  
- Hydrant must be **within 1,000 feet**.  

---

## 🔹 8. Binding Restrictions (Disasters)
- Authority **suspended** when disasters are imminent (tornado, wildfire, hurricane, flood).  
- Cannot bind/increase coverage once restrictions apply—even if it was discussed earlier.  

---

## 🔹 9. Backdating Coverage
- 🚫 **Never backdate** policies.  
- Only possible with explicit **underwriter approval**.  
- Doing so risks **compliance + E&O issues**.  

---

## 🔹 10. Communication & E&O Risk
- Words matter: saying *“You’re covered”* can bind you legally.  
- If wrong, **E&O insurance** may pay the claim.  
- Always verify form & endorsements before confirming.  

---

## 🔹 11. Partner/Broker Programs & Discounts
- Craft Lake / Chubb available when risk exceeds Farmers’ limits.  
- Auto/Home discount depends on state + auto program.  
- Smart Plan Auto → supports **broker discount** when home is placed through Craft Lake.  

---

## ✅ 12. Quick Agent Checklist
- 🔎 Confirm **policy form** (Smart Plan vs. Next-Gen).  
- 🏠 Verify **rebuild cost** (estimator + current costs).  
- 📸 Check **photo requirements** (> $1M).  
- 🚒 Ensure PPC & hydrant distance are compliant.  
- 📈 Recommend Extended/Guaranteed Replacement Cost.  
- 🏦 Route **>$3M, historic, or >$1M COC** to specialty markets.  
- 🌪️ Respect catastrophe binding restrictions.
