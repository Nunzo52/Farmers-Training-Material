# Westman_cheatsheet — Fire 211: Second Homes, Landlords, Vacation Rentals

> 🧭 **Quick-use field guide** for quoting, underwriting, and advising on second homes, vacation rentals (Airbnb/VRBO), and landlord exposures. Keep this beside PolicyCenter/ForAgents while you quote.

---

## 🟥 TL;DR (60‑second overview)
- **Secondary home (not rented):** Smart Plan Home ok **only if** the **named insured** uses it **exclusively for residential purposes**. Lending to friends/family (no rent) is fine. Charging **any rent** or listing on Airbnb/VRBO = **not eligible** for SPH → use **Foremost Vacation Rental** (DF‑3 preferred).  
- **Vacation rental:** Quote **Foremost DF‑3** (open perils, RC options, loss of rents). DF‑1 = last resort. Consider third‑party options with expanded specialty coverages if needed.  
- **Landlord:** Most states route to **Foremost**. Farmers Landlord Protector still exists in some states (e.g., CA), but: contents = **ACV**, **premises‑only** CPL, **no scheduled roof payment** (that’s homeowner only), building ordinance available (often up to 50%).  
- **Log homes:** Acceptable when **sized kit logs** and **licensed contractor built** on a standard foundation. **Hand‑hewn/DIY** log builds → **submit to UW** (often **not acceptable**).  
- **Docks/boathouses:** Separate structure if within **~100 ft** of the residence premises (confirm locally). Renting slips or allowing renters to use owner watercraft = **business/excluded**—check UW/claims.  
- **“My kid lives there now”**: If anyone other than the NI uses it as their **primary residence**, it’s **a rental exposure → Landlord policy**, even at $0 rent.  
- **Umbrella**: Strongly recommended when you (or the insured) own multiple homes or do any rental activity.

## 🟦 Eligibility & Occupancy — Decision Tree
**Start here:** *What is the property and who uses it?*

1) **Second Home / Seasonal (no rent)**
   - ✅ **Eligible**: Smart Plan Home (SPH) as **secondary** or **seasonal**.  
   - Rules: **NI must occupy**; **residential use only**; incidental office ok (add endorsement).  
   - ✅ Guests allowed (no rent). **Cleaning fee paid directly to vendor** is ok.  
   - ⚠️ If **any rent/fees** flow to NI or it’s listed on platforms → **Not eligible** for SPH.

2) **Short‑Term Rental (STR) / Vacation Rental**
   - ✅ **Route to Foremost** Vacation Rental program. Prefer **DF‑3** (open perils, RC options, Loss of Rents).  
   - ⚠️ Owner’s watercraft/jet skis for guest use = **excluded**.  
   - ⚠️ **Primary home rented for one‑off events (Ryder Cup, US Open, Final Four)** → **not what the Foremost STR program is for**. Use specialty/Lloyd’s‑type solutions if needed.

3) **Long‑Term Rental / “Kid lives there”**
   - ✅ **Landlord** (Foremost in most states).  
   - Rent amount **doesn’t matter**; **primary residence by non‑NI triggers landlord**.

4) **Log Home**
   - ✅ **Accept** if **kit/sized logs + licensed contractor + proper foundation**.  
   - ❌ **DIY/hand‑hewn** typically **not acceptable** (or require UW sign‑off).

## 🟨 Coverage Nuggets & Gotchas
- **Docks / Boathouses**: Treat as separate structures **within ~100 ft** of the premises. Renting a slip = **business exposure** (ask UW).  
- **Door codes/keys**: STR risk—codes spread, theft afterwards. Recommend **smart lock with rotating codes** + **post‑stay resets**.  
- **Electrical load**: Older cabins + many devices charging = fire risk; consider **updated wiring** as a risk‑control talking point.  
- **Bedbugs/infestations**: Often **excluded**; specialty STR forms may add limited coverage.  
- **Assault & battery**: Typically **excluded** under standard landlord/STR policies; some specialty STR programs add it.  
- **Alcohol gifts**: Leaving wine for guests creates **liquor liability** concerns; advise against it.  
- **Watercraft use by renters**: **Do not** allow; **not covered**.  
- **SPH scheduled roof payment**: Only applies to **homeowners**, **not** Landlord Protector.  
- **Umbrella**: Add for multi‑home portfolios and any rental exposure.

## 🟩 Product Routing (fast map)
| Scenario | Best first choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Second home (no rent), NI uses | **Farmers SPH** | NI must occupy; incidental office ok |
| STR / Airbnb / VRBO | **Foremost DF‑3** | Open perils, RC options, Loss of Rents; DF‑1 only if needed |
| Primary home rented for a big event | **Specialty markets** | Foremost STR not designed for this use |
| Long‑term rental (incl. $0 rent to family) | **Foremost Landlord** | In TX, PL **≤2‑family**; other states PL **≤4‑plex**; more units → commercial |
| Log home | **SPH** if kit/contractor | DIY/hand‑hewn → likely decline/submit to UW |

## 🟪 Underwriting Checklist (copy/paste to email the client)
- 🏠 **Occupancy**: Who will live there? Any rent or platform listing? Frequency?  
- 🧾 **Primary home**: Confirm NI’s primary is insured (Farmers/Foremost).  
- 🪵 **Construction** (if log): **Kit/sized logs? Licensed contractor? Foundation type?**  
- 🛶 **Water adjacent**: Dock/boathouse present? Distance to premises? Any slip fees? Watercraft use by guests?  
- 🔌 **Systems**: Electrical updates? Heating? Any wood stoves?  
- 🔐 **Access control** (STR): Smart locks? Code rotation between guests?  
- 🧹 **Turnover**: Professional cleaning vendor (invoice to guest vs owner)?  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Contracts**: Rental agreement/house rules; platform T&Cs; HOA/condo restrictions.  
- 🧯 **Risk controls**: Smoke/CO alarms, fire extinguishers, railings, deck integrity, trampoline/pool rules.  
- ☂️ **Umbrella**: Desired limit? Include all residences.

## 🟫 Quote Recipe — STR (Foremost DF‑3)
1) Identify usage cadence, platforms, and guest counts.  
2) Choose **DF‑3** form; set **Coverage A** from replacement tool; add:  
   - **Loss of Rents** (12 months ideal).  
   - **Replacement Cost** on dwelling & contents where available.  
   - **Theft** & **Vandalism** by tenants if available.  
3) Liability: push **$500k–$1M**; then add **umbrella**.  
4) Schedule discounts: tenant screening, multiple rentals, alarms, construction features.  
5) Exclusions/limitations briefing: watercraft, bedbugs, assault & battery, liquor liability, code compliance.

## 🟧 Client Scripts (ready to say)
- **Airbnb intent → move off SPH:**  
  “Because any rent converts this from a second home into a rental exposure, your best coverage is the Foremost vacation rental form. It’s designed for guest turnover, loss of rents, and the extra liability that platforms create.”

- **Kid living at the lake house year‑round:**  
  “Once it’s someone’s primary residence and not yours, insurance treats it as a rental—even at $0 rent. We’ll switch to a landlord form so claims get paid the right way.”

- **Watercraft ask:**  
  “I can’t insure guests using your jet skis. It’s excluded. If you ever allowed it, a loss could hit you personally. Let’s keep those off‑limits.”

---

## 🟦 Red Flags (pause and ask UW/Claims)
- Hand‑hewn/DIY log construction.  
- Renting dock slips or separate boathouse **for a fee**.  
- Primary residence listed for short‑term special events.  
- Trampolines, unfenced water access, elevated decks without guards.  
- Providing alcohol to guests.

---

## 🟩 Claims & Math Nuggets
- **Separate structure distance**: use **~100 ft** rule of thumb; confirm locally for on‑premises determination.  
- **Loss of Rents**: aim for **up to 12 months** on STR/landlord when available.  
- **SPH vs. Landlord property treatment**: SPH may have scheduled roof payment; **Landlord Protector does not**—roof settled per that form; contents on Landlord Protector are usually **ACV** and **on‑premises only**.

---

## 🟪 Multi‑State Placement Notes
- You can only write out‑of‑state second homes if you’re **licensed there** **and** have a Farmers DM **appointment** in that state. Otherwise, **refer** to a local Farmers agent.  
- Owning many homes? It’s fine to place them with one carrier, but always coordinate a **single umbrella** that schedules **all** properties.

- **Any rent** on a second home → **Foremost STR/landlord** (not SPH).  
- **Non‑NI primary occupant** → **Landlord**.  
- **Guests ask for owner’s jet skis** → **No; excluded**.  
- **DIY log** → **Decline or UW review**.  
- **Dock >100 ft from premises** → may **not** be “on premises” (confirm).
