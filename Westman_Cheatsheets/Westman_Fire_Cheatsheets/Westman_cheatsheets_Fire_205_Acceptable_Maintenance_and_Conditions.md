# Fire 205 — Acceptable Maintenance & Conditions
_A field-ready, colorful checklist for quick calls on acceptability, conditional binds, and what to fix first._

---

## 🔎 Pride of Ownership (First Pass)
**Question:** On balance, does the home look cared for?  
**YES cues:** sound paint, tidy yard, clear-ish gutters, intact rails/steps, organized storage.  
**NO cues:** multiple defects at once (peeling paint + debris piles + broken rails), tarps, cardboard windows, long-term “temporary” fixes.

**Rule of thumb:** One minor issue → memo. Three+ issues → a pattern → decline or **conditional bind only**.

---

## 🧹 Debris & “In-Progress” Work
- **Usually OK:** Small, short-lived piles that don’t create hazards **and** overall pride of ownership is strong.
- **Not OK:** Large/long-standing piles, demo debris up against the home, fuel/chemicals, sharp hazards, rodent harborage.
- **If a roof is being replaced now:**
  - You can **conditionally bind** if completion is imminent and **before inspection** (often ≥ 5–6 days out).  
  - **Document**: photos, promised completion date, and ask the inspector to delay until after completion.  
  - **Warn the insured**: if work isn’t finished → cancellation process triggers (insured & lender notified).

---

## 🌿 Vegetation on Structures
**General rule:** “Well‑maintained & manicured” can be acceptable, but vines on **wood/stucco** trap moisture (worse than on **brick**).

**Often acceptable:**
- Trellised vines **off the wall**, trimmed, not contacting eaves/gutters/vents.

**Often unacceptable:**
- Vegetation **touching/entering** gutters, vents, fascia, or creeping **under shingles**.
- Heavy, thorny vines over entries/walkways.

**Pro tip:** Note season. Dormant vines in winter can become roof/gutter contact in summer. Check street/satellite views from different dates.

---

## 🌳 Trees — Clearance & Condition
- **Clearance:** Branches **must not touch** roof/eaves/fascia. Target **≥ 3–4 in** minimum free space (more is better).  
- **Condition:** Big **healthy** trees ≠ “in danger of falling.” Dead/dying/ice‑weighted limbs **are** hazards.  
- **Roots:** Uplift/settlement from roots isn’t covered, but it’s still an acceptability red flag.

**Decline/repair triggers:**
- Any contact with roof/eaves; visible shingle abrasion; dead limbs over structures.  
- “Creative workarounds” (e.g., roof notched around a trunk) are only passable if clearance is maintained **and** the rest of the risk is clean.

---

## 🏚️ Surfaces, Stairs & Walkways
- **Paint:** Localized peeling may pass if everything else is solid; widespread failure → fix before binding.  
- **Rails/guards:** Broken/missing spindles or non‑code rail spacing = correct prior to bind.  
- **Trip hazards:** Raised slabs, exposed roots, thorny shrubs into sidewalks → liability exposure; request correction.

---

## 🏠 Roof Condition (Quick Flags)
- Worn granules, curled/lifted/missing shingles, tarps, long‑term patches = **not acceptable**.  
- Light, recent patching to industry standard may pass if roof condition is otherwise strong.  
- Leaves/debris in valleys are minor **if** isolated and overall pride of ownership is high.

**If snow-covered (can’t see the roof):** Request a delayed roof inspection when weather clears; bind can proceed with a hold for re‑inspection.

---

## 🏢 Location Context — Commercial Adjacency
Homes **within** commercial districts (not just “near a corner store”) face higher theft/vandalism/explosion exposures and weak natural surveillance at night.  
**Often not acceptable** unless very specific circumstances; expect declines.

---

## 🧰 Home Businesses & Outbuildings
- **Low‑exposure tutoring/teaching** or clerical **home offices** (no client traffic): usually OK.  
- **Client traffic or hazardous work** (e.g., salon, auto, tattoo, fabrication): needs a commercial policy.  
  - Home may be considered **only if** the business is placed (and kept) with the carrier and the exposure is eligible.
- Businesses in **separate structures** are **not covered** by the HO policy property coverage; treat as commercial.

---

## 🛏️ Roomers & Boarders
- Up to **two** roomers/boarders is typical maximum. Three+ → decline.  
- Roomers **are not covered** for property, loss of use, or liability under the host HO policy.  
- **Require renters’ insurance** from roomers (for liability & fire legal liability).  
- Unrelated roomers need **their own** separate renters policies.

---

## 🤸 Trampolines
**Default:** Decline unless specific safety conditions are met.

**Typical acceptable setup:**
- **Fenced yard** (functional fence; gate present). Rural or gated‑community exceptions may exist but are narrow—HOA docs often required, and the trampoline typically **cannot be visible from public roads or neighbors** in rural exception cases.
- Trampoline in **good repair** (no tears/broken poles). Netting is **not** a fence substitute.
- Front‑yard or unfenced setups → **decline**.
- In‑ground installation does **not** remove fencing/visibility requirements.

**Why it matters:** Unsupervised access = high severity injuries; fencing and placement reduce attractive nuisance risk.

---

## 🧾 Binding & Documentation Cheats
- **Photos now**, not later (front, sides, rear + any defect close‑ups).  
- **Note promises** with dates (e.g., “roof complete by 6/12; debris bin pickup 6/13”).  
- **Ask inspection** to occur **after** promised fixes.  
- **Set expectations**: non‑completion → cancellation; lender notices go out.  
- **Use maps**: satellite/street‑view history catches seasonal vegetation and hidden rear structures.

## ✅ Quick Triage Table
| Item | Likely OK | Needs Fix / Conditional | Likely Decline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debris | Small, short-term | Large piles w/ plan & date | Long‑standing, hazardous |
| Vegetation | Trellised, off wall | Light contact to trim | Into vents/eaves/under shingles |
| Trees | Clear of roof; healthy | Close but trimmable | Touching roof; dead limbs |
| Paint/rails | Minor peel; intact rails | Localized failures to patch | Widespread failure; missing rails |
| Roof | Clean architectural/3‑tab | Minor, recent patch | Tarps, curl/lift, missing shingles |
| Trampoline | Fenced, backyard, sound | Rural/gated exception | Front yard, visible, unfenced |
| Roomers | ≤ 2 with renters’ policies | — | 3+ roomers |
| Business | Low‑risk home office | With commercial policy placed | Hazardous work/client traffic without commercial |

## 🗣️ Phrases That Help (and Protect)
- “We can bind **once** these two items are trimmed/removed; I’ve noted inspection for after completion.”
- “Because there are **three separate concerns**, underwriting requires correction prior to binding.”
- “Roomers aren’t covered by your HO—please have them carry renters’ liability naming you as interested party.”

### Why this matters
Small exterior details predict **frequency & severity**. Catching them early protects your client, you, and the book.
