# Westman_cheatsheet — Fire 209: Building Law & Course of Construction

> **Scope:** Quick-reference crib for *Building Ordinance or Law (BOL)* and *Course of Construction (COC)* on Smart Plan Home (SPH) vs. legacy forms, with real‑world underwriting and claims gotchas.  
> **CO Focus:** Inline callouts flagged with 🟦 **Colorado**.

## 🔧 Building Ordinance or Law (BOL)

**What it is:** Extra coverage to pay the *increased cost* to comply with **current** codes after a covered loss.

### The three moving parts
1) **Code Upgrades to the Damaged Portion** – bring the *damaged* area up to current code.  
2) **Demolition of the Undamaged Portion** – if the AHJ requires the rest to be torn down.  
3) **Rebuild of the Undamaged Portion** – to current code, when demolition is required.

> ✅ **Included on SPH:** Dwelling (Cov A) **and** Other Structures (Cov B).  
> ⚠️ **NextGen nuance:** BOL typically applies to **Cov A only** (exception details vary by state; TX historically broader). If you need BOL on Cov B, move to SPH.

### Limits you can select (as % of Coverage A)
- **10%** (default on many forms) • **25%** • **50% (max)**  
- Rule of thumb: the **older** the structure and the **stricter** the local code/retrofit regime, the more you should push **50%**.

🟦 **Colorado:** Age‑diverse housing stock + active AHJ enforcement. Wildland‑Urban Interface (WUI), energy code, egress sizing, electrical service upgrades, and deck/stair standards frequently trigger BOL dollars. In older Denver/Boulder/Front Range inventory, 25% can be light—**recommend 50%** when value and budget allow.

### What BOL does **not** do
- Market stigma/value loss
- Land stabilization, grading, or slope failure repair
- Optional betterments (e.g., finishing a basement that wasn’t there)
- Increased cost due to **moving** the rebuild offsite (we pay what it would cost **at the original site**)
- Pre‑loss known noncompliance you were already ordered to fix
- Costs from **delayed** rebuilding beyond “timely repair”

### Trigger + payout logic
- BOL pays **only after** repair/replacement is underway. No rebuild = **ACV** only for dwelling/structures; **no BOL** dollars.
- If AHJ orders demo of undamaged remainder, BOL Part (2) + (3) respond up to the % limit.

#### Mini math (teach-back friendly)
- Cov A = **$200k**, BOL = **10%** (=$20k), ERC = **150%**.  
- Total rebuild = **$290k**, of which **$30k** is code.  
- If insured **rebuilds:** dwelling up to ERC as applicable **+** BOL pays up to **$20k** for code items. Any code cost > $20k is OOP.  
- If insured **doesn’t rebuild:** dwelling settled at **ACV**; **$0** from BOL.

### Underwriting cues (field/desk)
- Year built vs. major system updates (roof, electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- Egress window sizes/railing heights in older bedrooms/stairs
- Detached structures to code? (garage conversion, studio, dock, retaining wall)  
- AHJ posture: seismic/energy/fire-sprinkler retrofits; demo thresholds (often % of structure impacted)
- Prior notices/violations on file (pre‑loss orders are **not** BOL)

🟦 **Colorado:** hail-driven roof cycles, deck collapses, wildfire defensible‑space ordinances, and electrical service upsizing are frequent code drivers. Flag older detached garages/ADUs—BOL on **Cov B** matters on SPH.

## 🏗️ Course of Construction (COC) — Owner-placed

**Purpose:** Cover a **new, owner-occupied home** while it’s being built when the **builder isn’t** carrying Builders Risk.

### Eligibility (all must be true)
- **New construction** (not extensive renovation)  
- Insured value = **100% of completed value** (**did/should penalty applies**)  
- Title/Named insured = **individual** (not LLC/S‑Corp)  
- Intended use = **owner‑occupied** (not spec/flip/investment)  
- Term: up to **12 months**; auto-terminates **30 days after Certificate of Occupancy**

> ❌ Not for **extensive remodels**, pop‑tops, gut rehabs, or flips → use a **Builders Risk** market + (often) a temporary renters/contents solution.

### Coverages & exclusions
- Covers **Cov A & B** during build; priced on staged value (discounted vs. finished-home premium)
- **No** Extended RC or BOL on COC (it’s *brand‑new* work to current code)
- **Vacancy** condition waived during construction
- **No liability** for injury to contractors/laborers/design pros (their WC/GL responds)

### The **did/should** penalty (contract language)
- If Completed Value **did** = $200k but **should** = $400k, and loss = $52k → payout = **$26k** (50% coinsurance).  
- Always bind at **100% completed value** to avoid unhappy math.

### When to steer to **Builders Risk**
- GC controls site and declines owner-placed coverage
- Timeline > 12 months / custom or phased
- Renovations, additions, pop‑tops, structural retrofits
- Multi‑entity ownership, LLC trust title, or spec intent

🟦 **Colorado:** Weather delays (freeze, hail), elevation logistics, and WUI mitigations commonly push timelines. If >12 months likely, **Builders Risk** is the safer lane from day one.

## 🧭 Decision flow (fast talk track)

1) **What’s happening?** New build or remodel? Who carries risk during build?  
2) **Form fit:**  
   - **New build & owner-occupied:** SPH + **COC endorsement** (meet all tests)  
   - **Renovation/addition/spec/LLC:** **Builders Risk** market  
3) **BOL dial:** Older stock or strict AHJ? Push **50%** (esp. if Cov B exposures).  
4) **Expectations:** BOL pays after rebuild; ACV only if no rebuild.  
5) **Colorado angle:** WUI/egress/energy + hail/deck codes → BOL 50% recommended.

## 👀 Field checklist (use at every home visit)

- ▢ Year built + last full-system updates (roof/electrical/plumbing/HVAC)  
- ▢ Egress windows / guard & handrail heights / deck integrity  
- ▢ Detached structures age/use (garage/ADU/shop/dock) → needs BOL on **Cov B**  
- ▢ Pools/trampolines/fencing and premises liability hazards  
- ▢ Any tents/fumigation/remediation present today? (timing for binding)  
- ▢ AHJ letters/permits/stop-work or demo orders on file?  
- ▢ For COC: completed value, C of O timeline, GC insurance proof

🟦 **Colorado:** Add defensible space, roof class (impact‑resistant), and deck fire‑resistance in WUI zones to your walk‑around.

## 📜 Micro-scripts

**BOL upgrade:**  
“Because the home’s from the 60s and Denver inspectors will require today’s egress and electrical standards if there’s a loss, I’m setting Ordinance or Law at **50%**. It’s the difference between moving back in on budget—or writing a five‑figure check.”

**COC vs. Builders Risk:**  
“Owner‑occupied *new* build? We can add a COC rider to your SPH. If it’s a pop‑top or a flip—or the builder controls coverage—Builders Risk is the right tool.”

---

### 🧩 Quick examples (coach your team)

- **Detached garage crushed by tree; AHJ mandates 2‑car minimum:** BOL on **Cov B** funds the delta (up to % limit). Without BOL on Cov B = OOP.  
- **Half-burned 1910 home; city orders full demo:** BOL pays demo + rebuild of the undamaged half up to limit.  
- **Insured sells land and rebuilds across town:** We pay what it would cost to rebuild **at original site**; offsite incremental cost is OOP.

---

### 📌 Colorado fast facts (operational, not legal advice)
- WUI/defensible space and ignition‑resistant construction increasingly enforced across foothills; decks/rails get attention.  
- Hail corridor realities → frequent roof code touches (decking, ventilation, underlayment).  
- Energy/egress updates are common triggers in older Denver/Boulder/Colo Springs housing.  
**Action:** default BOL **50%** where budget-tolerant; document your recommendation.

### Submission notes (what UW/Claims will thank you for)
- Photos: main, sides, rear, **detached structures**, decks/stairs/rails, service panel, roof condition  
- AHJ comms: any prior variances, notices, or demo/retrofit thresholds if known  
- For COC: budget, plans, schedule, GC COI, and completed-value basis

---

**That’s it.** Keep this pinned. When in doubt: *older + Colorado + AHJ = BOL 50%*. For builds: “new & owner = COC; anything else = Builders Risk.”
