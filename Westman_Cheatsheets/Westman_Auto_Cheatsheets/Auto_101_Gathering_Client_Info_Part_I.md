# Auto 101 — Gathering Client Info (Part I)

> **Scope:** Quick-reference crib for *gathering client information* in auto/home quoting.  
> **Focus:** Intake efficiency, professional presentation, and avoiding “ballpark quote” traps.  
> **CO Style:** Inline callouts flagged with 🟦 **Colorado** (when applicable).

---

## 🎯 Why Ballpark Quotes Fail

- Modern rating = **dozens of factors** → no reliable ballpark.  
- Agents who “guess” = **busy + underpaid** (rework, bad trust).  
- ✅ **Best practice:** Get *all* info once, quote once.  

> **Script:** “Accurate quotes come from accurate info. Let’s grab everything now so your first price is the right price.”

## 🧾 Intake Essentials (One-Pass Checklist)

### 🏠 Household & Drivers
- ▢ Names + DOBs for **all household members** (even non-drivers)  
- ▢ DL numbers / states / status  
- ▢ Non-driver DOBs = future drivers, birthdays, life marketing

### 🚗 Vehicles
- ▢ VINs (from reg/door jamb)  
- ▢ Year / Make / Model / Mileage / Use / Garaging address  
- ▢ Lienholder info

### 📑 Insurance & History
- ▢ Current carrier / policy / renewal date  
- ▢ Limits, deductibles, discounts  
- ▢ Claims / violations / SR-22?  
- ▢ Consent for credit-based rating (where allowed)

### 🏡 Property (if bundling)
- ▢ Roof age / materials / updates  
- ▢ Pools / decks / detached structures  
- ▢ AHJ retrofit rules / demo thresholds

## 📡 Channels — Acceptable vs. Best

> **Rule of thumb:** Phone → In-person for full intake & signatures

- 📱 **Text** → Only if client requests; small asks (VIN photo)  
- 📧 **Email** → Fast, attaches docs; tone & permanence risks  
- 📠 **Fax** → Rare, lender-only; 🚫 not for SSNs/credit cards  
- ☎️ **Phone** → Clarify instantly; build rapport  
- 🤝 **In-person** → Best for trust, SSN/credit consent, full intake

---

## 🏠 Meeting Locations

- ☕ **Coffee shop / diner** → Casual, convenient, but noisy/no privacy  
- 🏡 **Client’s home** → ✅ Highest show rate; docs & VINs on-site; see risks/assets  
- 🏢 **Your office** → Tools/team ready; 🚫 higher no-show risk

🟦 **Colorado:** Hail + wildfire WUI ordinances = more need for on-site assessment.

---

## 🪑 Seating & Body Language

- Keep partners **together** (nonverbal communication counts)  
- Avoid “interrogation” setups (you opposite both)  
- Ensure eye contact with **farther person** (≥60%)  
- ✅ Best: You on side; couple adjacent on long side of table

---

## 👔 Professional Presence

- **Attire:** Dress for market (logo polo + chinos often best). Can dress down (remove jacket), can’t dress up mid-meeting.  
- **Fragrance:** Minimal; avoid triggers.  
- **Hospitality:** Accept water/coffee; decline food politely; 🚫 never alcohol.  

---

## 🔑 Handling SSN & Credit-Based Rating

- ✅ **Why:** Carrier’s filed rates require it; prevents surprises.  
- **Script:** “The only way to return the true price is with SSN. Otherwise we risk quoting the wrong premium.”  
- Collect **in person or secure**; avoid fax/email.

---

## 📞 Call Cadence & Renewals

- ≤ **3 contacts** (call + recap email + confirming text).  
- Renewal notices ~**58–60 days** pre-renewal.  
- ✅ Call at **75–90 days**: plant seed, beat the bill, book follow-up.  

---

## 🧭 Quick Decision Flow

1) ❓ **What’s happening?** Quote, renewal, or cross-sell?  
2) 📡 **How to gather?** Phone → in person.  
3) 🏠 **Where to meet?** Home > Office > Public.  
4) 🔑 **SSN/credit?** Position as accuracy safeguard.  
5) 📅 **Renewal timing?** 75–90 days ahead.  

---

## 👀 Field Cues

- ▢ Year built vs. system updates (roof, electrical, HVAC)  
- ▢ Detached garages/ADUs: BOL relevance (if bundling)  
- ▢ Pools / trampolines / hazards  
- ▢ AHJ code posture (egress, decks, sprinklers)  
- ▢ 🟦 Colorado: hail, wildfire WUI, deck/fire-resistant codes

## 🗣️ Micro-Scripts

**💬 Ballpark deflect:**  
“Price matters—but today’s rating has dozens of factors. If we guess, we risk wasting your time. Let’s gather everything once so your first price is the right one.”

**💬 SSN request:**  
“To avoid surprises later, the carrier system requires SSN for an accurate rate. Sharing it now prevents rework and frustration.”

**💬 Move from café → home:**  
“It’s a bit public to go through license numbers and DUIs here. If we meet at your kitchen table or my office, we can wrap it all up in one sitting.”

**💬 Renewal timing:**  
“Carriers send bills about 60 days out. I’ll call ~90 days ahead so we can line up discounts before you pay the bill.”
