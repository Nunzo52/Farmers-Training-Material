# Auto 102 — Gathering Client Info (Part II)

> **Scope:** Quick-reference crib for *Motor Vehicle Records (MVR), CLUE, chargeability, subrogation, VIN accuracy, and car symbols*.  
> **Focus:** Quote accuracy, expectation-setting, and avoiding rework.  
> **Style:** Matches Part I (emoji sections, clean Markdown).

## 🚓 MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) — Run It *Before* You Propose

- **Run MVR prior to pricing** (where cost-effective). Time saved > MVR fee.  
- Cost varies by state (e.g., **CA ≈ low single dollars**, some states **$15–$28**+). Treat as **cost of doing business** or seek alternatives if prohibitive.
- **Why:** Customers misremember dates, omit Uber/work-vehicle tickets, or assume commercial = non‑chargeable.

### Asking about history (better prompt)
> “**When** was your **last ticket**? Any **accidents** since then?”  
Avoid “last **3 years**?” (recall bias). Verify with MVR.

### Chargeable vs. Not (MVR side)
**Not chargeable (generally):**  
- Defective equipment “fix‑it” (except **bad brakes**), missing reg/tabs, no DL **on person** (but licensed), **parking/pedestrian** tickets.  
- **Commercial vehicles requiring special licensing** (e.g., medallion taxi, CDL tractor-trailer) — tickets typically rate on commercial, not personal.

**Chargeable (watch these):**  
- **Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)** citations — **chargeable** (personal class vehicle).  
- “Work truck” pickups/landscaper rigs w/o CDL classing — **chargeable** on personal auto if rated there.  
- **Bicycle** moving violations can be coded and appear (varies) — don’t assume they’re invisible.

> ✅ **Practice:** Run the MVR; don’t rely on memory or assumptions.

## 📄 CLUE — Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange

- Carrier-reported **claims history** (comp, collision, med pay, towing, glass).  
- Pulled automatically in quote/validation flows.  
- **Different from MVR:** CLUE has **claims**, MVR has **violations**/state-accident reports.

**Watch for:** Incidents not on MVR (no police report) but **filed with prior carrier** → still impact underwriting.

---

## 💥 Fault, Chargeability & “Fault‑Free” Buckets

**Fault‑free examples (generally):**  
- **Legally parked** vehicle struck (parking legality gives claims some discretion; still typically fault‑free).  
- **Stopped for traffic** (rear‑ended / left‑turn into you).  
- **Animal hits** → **Comprehensive**, not collision.  
- **Reimbursed in full** by other party / **judgment** against them.  
- Prior carrier confirms **not‑at‑fault** via **Experience Letter** (needed when CLUE is “questionable”).  
- 🟦 **CA nuance:** < **51%** at fault → treated **fault‑free**. Other states may still rate partial fault.

**Pileups (A–E chain‑rear‑end):**  
- **A (front)** = not at fault; **E (rear-most)** = at fault.  
- **B–D** often murky → set **expectation**: deductible recovery is **unlikely/slow**.

---

## 🔁 Subrogation & Deductible Recovery — Set Expectations

- Carrier pays your client, then **subrogates** against the at‑fault party.  
- **Deductible returned** only as subrogation funds are recovered. May take **months/years**, may be **partial** (pro‑rata).  
- **Pro‑rata split** example: If only **31%** of total paid is recovered, insured gets **~31%** of their deductible back.

> ⚠️ **Counsel on deductibles:** Higher deductibles lower premium but increase out‑of‑pocket and recovery risk in murky‑fault or low‑limit scenarios. Consider **UMPD** (where offered) to reduce OOP.

---

## 🔢 VIN Accuracy — Tiny Digits, Big Pricing

- VIN is **17 characters** (since 1981). **No “I” or “O”** → they’re **1** and **0**.  
- Decoder basics:  
  - **1–3**: Country / Manufacturer (e.g., **J** = Japan; **JT** Toyota Japan).  
  - **4–8**: Model/engine/safety/options (airbags, ABS, drivetrain, trim…).  
  - **9**: Check digit.  
  - **10**: **Model year**.  
  - **11**: Plant.  
  - **12–17**: Serial.

**Why it matters:** Safety features, performance trim, AWD/4WD, hybrids, etc., all flow from VIN → **rate class, symbol, eligibility**.

**Severe prior damage flags:** Flood/frame/salvage indicators can **block** or re‑route eligibility (state‑specific).

---

## 🏋️ Vehicle Eligibility & Work Trucks

- **Dooleys (F‑350, etc.)**: Often acceptable if VIN decodes within state limits.  
- **F‑450 / GVWR thresholds**: State/form‑specific caps (many allow up to **≈14,000 GVWR**; check current guide).  
- **Severe prior damage** may decline.

> ✅ Always **enter VIN** to determine eligibility and rating — don’t assume by badge alone.

---

## 💸 Car Symbols (Hidden but Heavy)

- Controls rating for **Comp & Collision** (not liability).  
- Based on **Port‑of‑Entry** price (original new value), not today’s used price.  
- Symbol scale increases cost **multipliers** as value/performance rises.
- **High‑performance trims** (WRX STI, Evo) carry **higher symbols** (and sometimes extra surcharges).

### Marketing/Underwriting Adjustments (What you see as “why is this off?”)
- **Theft‑prone models** (e.g., certain Civics/Accords) → **symbol bumped up** → Comp $$ ↑.  
- **Family haulers** (e.g., minivans/SUVs) may be **symbol‑favored** to compete.  
- **Truck trims** (e.g., F‑250) sometimes symbol‑adjusted due to theft/frequency spikes.

> 👉 Bottom line: **VIN + symbol** drive physical damage pricing. Quote with VIN; don’t promise pre‑VIN rates.

## 🧭 Quick Talk Tracks

**Run MVR first:**  
“Let’s get your driving record now—saves both of us from a re‑quote later.”

**Charges on Uber/work rig:**  
“Tickets in rideshare or work pickups still rate on personal auto unless it’s a true commercial class vehicle.”

**Deductible recovery realism:**  
“We’ll pursue the other party, but refunds only come as funds are recovered—sometimes partial, sometimes none.”

**VIN insistence:**  
“The VIN tells me trim, safety, and options—without it, the price can be wrong by a lot.”

**Symbol surprise:**  
“This model’s theft/performance history pushes its comp/collision symbol up—that’s why it prices higher than you’d expect.”

## ✅ Do / 🚫 Don’t (Part II)

**Do**  
- ✅ Run **MVR** early (cost‑benefit).  
- ✅ Pull **CLUE** and request **Experience Letters** for “questionable” events.  
- ✅ Collect **full VINs** from the car/reg photo.  
- ✅ Set **subro timelines** and **deductible** expectations up front.  
- ✅ Verify **eligibility** for heavy/light‑duty trucks via VIN.

**Don’t**  
- ❌ Quote before MVR/CLUE when feasible.  
- ❌ Assume rideshare or work‑truck tickets won’t rate.  
- ❌ Promise deductible refunds.  
- ❌ Hand‑type VINs from memory; **photo it** instead.  
- ❌ Guess symbols from MSRP/trim names.

## 📝 Self‑Check (5‑Minute Quiz)

1) List two items **not chargeable** from MVR and two that **are** (edge cases).  
2) What’s the **difference** between MVR and CLUE?  
3) Explain **pro‑rata** deductible recovery with a quick example.  
4) Why does VIN accuracy change **pricing and eligibility**?  
5) What is a **car symbol**, and why might it be higher for one trim than another?

### 🧩 Field Note
> Accuracy beats speed: **MVR + CLUE + VIN** first → fewer re‑quotes, cleaner binds, happier clients.

---

**That’s it.** Keep this pinned alongside Part I. *Run MVR, trust CLUE, insist on VINs, and coach on deductibles.*
