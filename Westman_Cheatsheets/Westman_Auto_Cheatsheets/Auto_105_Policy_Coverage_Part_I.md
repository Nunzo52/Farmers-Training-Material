# Auto 105 — Policy Coverage Part I

> **Scope:** Property Damage (PD) & Bodily Injury (BI) liability basics, legal obligations, defense duty, inflation impact, who is an “insured person,” delivery/rideshare exclusions, and key service talk-tracks.

---

## 🧭 <span style="color:#2E86C1">1) What Liability Actually Promises</span>
**Insuring Agreement (BI/PD):** We pay what an insured is **legally obligated** to pay **because of an auto accident**, subject to the policy’s terms, conditions, exclusions, and **limits**.  
- Once **limits are exhausted**, the **duty to defend ends**. <span style="color:#C0392B">Avoid the “you’re on your own now” letter</span> → recommend higher limits + umbrella.

---

## 🧱 <span style="color:#2E86C1">2) Property Damage (PD): Definition & Exposure</span>
**PD** = physical injury to tangible property **including loss of use**.  
Examples from class:
- **Utility pole knocked down** → **business outages** (loss of use), spoiled inventory (e.g., florist with orchids), IT shops sent home.  
- **Storefront intrusion** (vehicle into restaurant): building repairs, fixtures, contamination cleanup, **health-department recert**, **business income loss**.  
- **High-value vehicles** (Tesla, Fisker): repair scarcity → potential **total loss** settlements.  
- **Chain collisions** (A–D): rear-most driver often at fault for striking; comparative liability can cascade → **multiple PD/BI claims**.  
- **Transport lots** (rows of luxury cars): a single sideswipe can tag **seven-figure PD**.

**Agency move:** Set your **agency baseline** (e.g., **$100k–$250k PD min** or part of 250/500/250) and **document** any client choice to go lower.

## ❤️ <span style="color:#2E86C1">3) Bodily Injury (BI): What Counts</span>
**BI** = bodily harm, sickness, disease, or death → compensatory damages such as:  
- **Medical** (ER, surgeries, imaging, rehab), **ambulance/air-evac** (helicopter can be **$10k–$60k+** depending on market).  
- **Wage loss / loss of earning capacity** (e.g., $70k/yr × 2 yrs = $140k).  
- **Pain & suffering**, **loss of consortium/companionship**, and other legally recoverable non-economic damages.

**Insurer settlement authority:** Policy grants the insurer the right to **settle when deemed appropriate**—they defend, negotiate, and pay up to limits.

---

## 📈 <span style="color:#2E86C1">4) Inflation Reality Check — Rule of 72</span>
Medical inflation compounds (commonly **high single to low double digits**). Using the **Rule of 72**:  
- At **12%**, purchasing power halves in **~6 years**.  
- That 250/500 chosen a decade ago may **not stretch far** today.  
<span style="color:#C0392B">Action:</span> During reviews, re-anchor BI/UM-UIM/PD to **today’s medical & wage costs**.

---

## 👥 <span style="color:#2E86C1">5) Who Is an “Insured Person” (BI/PD)</span>
- **You** = Named insured on Declarations; **spouse** if **resident of the same household** (or named).  
- **Family member** = Related by **blood, marriage, or adoption** who **resides with you** (also ward/foster child).  
- **Permissive user** = **Any person using your insured auto with your permission**.  
- **Vicarious liability** = Certain **organizations** (e.g., Meals on Wheels) may be insured with respect to **their legal liability** for your use on their behalf.

**Reasonable belief of permission:** No coverage if a driver **lacks a reasonable belief** they’re permitted—**except** some forms preserve coverage for **resident family using a car you own** (e.g., teen takes your Corvette despite “don’t drive it”). Always verify state/form wording.

**College-to-Post‑Grad pitfall:**  
- **Away at college** and still listed → usually still **family member** (temporary residence).  
- **Graduates/moves out** → typically **no longer resident relative** → loses off-vehicle coverages (e.g., as a pedestrian), even if still listed to preserve discounts. <span style="color:#C0392B">Fix with their own policy.</span>

## 📦 <span style="color:#2E86C1">6) “Carrying for a Fee” & Deliveries</span>
Most **personal auto** forms exclude BI/PD **while carrying persons/property for compensation**. Smart Plan Auto expressly calls out:  
- **Delivering products/documents/newspapers/food** (e.g., pizzeria, DoorDash).  
- **Rideshare** typically excluded unless you have the **rideshare endorsement** (covered periods vary).  
- **Carpooling/expense-share to work** is **not excluded** (sharing gas ≠ carrying for a fee).

**Agent play:** Ask about side gigs. Offer **rideshare/delivery solutions** or refer to appropriate commercial policies.

---

## 🏛️ <span style="color:#2E86C1">7) Limits & Umbrellas</span>
- States set low **minimums**; clients can buy to the carrier’s **maximum auto limits** and then add a **Personal Umbrella** (often **$1M–$10M**).  
- Where available, add **UM/UIM on the umbrella** (requires meeting underlying limits).  
- <span style="color:#27AE60">Positioning line:</span> “Do you want us to pay **everything legally allowable** so you don’t risk assets or wages? Let’s set BI/PD high and add a $1M–$2M umbrella.”

---

## 🧰 <span style="color:#2E86C1">8) Talk Tracks & Checklists</span>
**Defense cutoff script:**  
> “Once liability limits are used up, the carrier’s duty to defend ends. Higher limits + umbrella keep the defense meter running longer—so you don’t hire an attorney out of pocket.”

**Delivery/rideshare disclosure:**  
> “If you deliver food or rideshare, personal auto may not apply during those periods. Let’s add the right endorsement or policy so you’re not uninsured.”

**BI/PD Review bullets (CRM paste):**  
- Confirm household members & **residency** status.  
- Ask about **gig driving/deliveries**.  
- Reassess BI/PD & **UM/UIM** for medical/wage inflation.  
- Offer **umbrella** (and UM/UIM on umbrella if supported).  
- Document any **declinations** in writing.

## 🟣 Colorado-Specific Notes
### 💸 Minimums & Practicality
- Colorado minimums: **25/50/15** (BI per person/BI per accident/PD).  
- <span style="color:#E67E22">Low for Front Range costs</span>—position **250/500/250** or **$500k CSL** + **umbrella**.

### 🚕 Delivery & Rideshare
- Denver/Boulder gig density is high—expect many clients to **DoorDash/Uber**. Ensure the **rideshare endorsement** (where applicable) or route to commercial. **Food delivery** is not covered on personal auto without specific solutions.

### 👨‍🎓 Students & Young Adults
- CU/CSU/DU out-of-house students often trigger the **post‑grad residency cliff**. Audit residency each renewal; set a calendar to split policies on graduation.

### 🧾 Statutes & Claims Practicalities
- CO statute of limitations: **3 years** for auto injury/PD, **2 years** wrongful death. Suit papers can arrive **near the deadline**—forward **immediately**.

---

## 🔚 Bottom Line
- **Legal obligation** drives payment—then **limits** cap it—then **defense stops**.  
- **Inflation** erodes old limits; **raise BI/PD & UM/UIM**, add **umbrella**.  
- **Know “insured person” precisely** to avoid unpleasant surprises.  
- **Gig-use clarity** prevents denials.
