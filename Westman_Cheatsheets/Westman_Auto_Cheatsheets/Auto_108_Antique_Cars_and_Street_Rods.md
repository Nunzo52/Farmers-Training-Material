## 🎯 What qualifies as an **Antique Auto** (Farmers)
- **Age:** ≥ **25 years** old.  
- **Type:** *Private passenger auto* (cars or light trucks).  
- **Condition:** *Restored or maintained in its original condition.* (Repaint/graphics OK; heavy chassis/engine/suspension mods are **not**.)  
- **Use:** Exhibitions, **car club** activities, **parades**, other **public‑interest** functions — plus “**occasionally for other purposes**.”

> **Occasional personal use** is fine (e.g., Sunday drive, coffee run). **Not** OK: primary commuting / daily passenger transport.

---

## 🧩 Photos & Appraisals
- **Photos required** at binding: **front+side** or **rear+side** (clear exterior views).  
- **Appraisal:** not required at quoting/binding; becomes critical at **claim** time to establish value.

---

## 💵 Rating & Policy Setup (Farmers)
- Start the quote as **Antique** policy type (different rating workflow). If you don’t, you won’t get correct program/rates and you **can’t convert later**—start over.
- **Comp:** 100% of normal rate.  
- **Collision:** ~**20%** of normal rate (limited‑use discount).  
- **Liability/UM/Med:** steeply discounted (**~10–12%** of standard), and **no** affinity/specialty/multi‑car discounts apply.  
- **VINs:** many antiques have short VINs — **left‑pad with zeros** to 17 chars.  
- **Model on dec page:** system may show **“Other.”** Overwrite with the real model so the dec page looks right.

> Think of Antique as a separate program/interface. Antique vehicles **do not** give your other cars multi‑car discounts.

---

## 🛡️ Physical Damage Value Logic (Farmers Antique Endorsement)
- You enter an **appraised/declared amount** to **determine premium**,  
  but settlement follows policy language: **repair/replace up to ACV** at loss time (not guaranteed/agreed value).  
- Keep the declared amount **current**; document upgrades.

> Want a true **Agreed Value** settlement? Place with a specialty market (e.g., **Hagerty** / **JC Taylor**) that locks the dollar figure up‑front.

**Coverage scope on the endorsement:** only the vehicle **listed** on the endorsement is the insured car. No automatic coverage for additional/replacement/rental cars.

**Use clause:** “principally” for exhibitions/club/parades, and **“occasionally for other purposes.”** Regular commuting for months would likely defeat the reduced‑premium basis (expect endorsement consequences).

---

## ❌ Common Declines (Farmers Antique / Standard Auto)
- **Kit/replica vehicles** (e.g., Cobra kit, MG kit, Caterham, Porsche Speedster replica).  
- **Race/track vehicles**, slicks, roll cages, logbooks, or obvious competition setup.  
- **Heavily modified** performance builds (blowers, nitrous, extreme lowers/lifts).  
- **Over‑lifted** trucks (> ~4" raise/lower).  
- **Commercial/utility/off‑road** vehicles (active use).

> Pro tip: Always get **interior + engine bay** photos to spot tachometers, roll cages, blowers, fuel cells, etc.

## ✅ Perfect Fits for **Specialty Markets** (Hagerty / JC Taylor)
**They love:** antiques & classics, modified street rods/lowriders/tuners (with rules), exotics/supercars, military classics (**weapons disabled**), vehicles under restoration, collections, plus automobilia/tools and **evacuation expense**.

**Typical rules:**  
- **Agreed Value** settlements (they appraise/confirm).  
- Usage limits (annual mileage bands; **no track use**).  
- **Secure storage** (no street/lot parking).  
- Driver MVR screens (e.g., no DUI/reckless; watch for **excessive speed** histories).  
- Some categories have **minimum values** (e.g., tuners often ≥ ~$30k).

**Hagerty highlights:**  
- **Agreed Value** in writing.  
- **Evacuation expense:** 50% of cost up to **$250 per vehicle** to move cars out of harm’s way.  
- **Collections program:** dedicated reps, automatic new‑purchase coverage, quarterly value increases.  
- **Automobilia/tools** coverage for displays, signage, parts.  
- **Off‑track** coverage available for race cars (storage/transport) — **not** competition.

> Storage note (Hagerty): street/lot/public garage storage is typically **unacceptable**. Aim for locked/private storage.

## 🧠 Quote Flow — Fast Talk Track
1. **What is it?** Antique original vs. kit/replica vs. modified build.  
2. **How’s it used/stored?** Shows, club, parades; secure garage? Any commuting? Any track time?  
3. **Where to place?**  
   - **Original, light mods + occasional use:** try **Farmers Antique**.  
   - **Kit/replica, heavy mods, exotics, restorations, collections, military, tuners/lowriders:** **Hagerty / JC Taylor**.  
4. **Value & docs:** photos now; appraisal if specialty/claim‑prone.  
5. **Set expectations:** ACV vs. Agreed Value, usage limits, storage needs, and decline triggers.

## 📝 Micro‑Scripts (client‑facing)
- **Eligibility framing:** “Because it’s 25+ years and mostly original, we can use our Antique program—big savings on liability/collision.”  
- **When to pivot:** “Since it’s a Cobra replica with performance mods, specialty markets like Hagerty give you **Agreed Value** and are built for this.”  
- **Occasional use boundary:** “Shows, parades, weekend drives are perfect. Daily commuting would move it out of Antique pricing.”

---

## 🔎 Spotters’ Guide (photos to request)
- Exterior: **front+side** or **rear+side** (full vehicle).  
- **Engine bay & interior** (catch blowers, tach/roll cage, fuel cells).  
- Undercarriage/hubs (lift/lower evidence).  
- Storage: garage/barn (prove secure).

## 🧭 Decision Matrix

| Vehicle | Condition | Use/Storage | Market | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ’55 Chevy, original | Restored OEM | Shows, parades, garaged | **Farmers Antique** | Discounted liability/collision |
| ’68 Mustang, lowered w/ tach | Performance mods | Weekend cruises | **Hagerty/JCT** | Mods push to specialty |
| Cobra kit/replica | Kit | Limited use | **Hagerty/JCT** | Agreed Value only |
| Over‑lifted ’75 4x4 | 8–10" lift | Off‑road | **Decline (Farmers)** → Specialty? | Storage & use scrutinized |
| Vintage military Jeep | Original, **weapons disabled** | Shows | **Hagerty/JCT** | Armaments removed/disabled |
| Antique bus/truck | Original/retired | Displays | **Hagerty/JCT** | No active commercial hauling |

---

## 🚫 Track & Competition
- No standard market covers **on‑track** use. Some specialty will cover **off‑track** exposure for race cars (storage/transport), but **not** competition.

---

## 📦 Quick Reminders
- **Tonneau covers** etc. belong to equipment discussions (Auto 107); Antique focus is vehicle eligibility/value/use.  
- When in doubt, **submit photos** and ask UW **before** binding.
