## 🎨 Additional / Customized Equipment (AE)
**Auto-included:** $1,000 AE with **Comp and/or Collision** (catch‑all in case we miss something).  
**Best practice:** *List it anyway* when it matters.

### ✅ What counts as AE (3-part test)
> **Permanently attached** + **Common to its use** + **Not from factory**

Examples:
- 🔊 Audio/video, game systems, aftermarket nav
- ✳️ Paint/chrome/wraps/graphics beyond factory (exposure = custom cost **minus** factory cost)
- 🛞 Wheels/tires/exhaust; exterior body gear (brush guards, winches, skid plates, light bars)
- ⚙️ Engine/transmission/suspension modifications
- 🧭 Hard-mounted GPS
- 🧩 Fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitches **in bed** (AE on **vehicle**, not trailer)

### ❌ Not AE (common misses)
- 🧳 **Removable** decks/amps/power boosters
- 📻 Radar/laser detectors
- 💿 Media (CDs, games, etc.)
- 🏕️ **Camper bodies / slide-ins** (use **Camper Endorsement**, not AE)
- 📦 **Tonneau covers** — **excluded unless specifically endorsed as AE** under SPA

### 🧾 Endorsing AE
- List items & values (no “$8k lump sum” without description).
- **Deductible:** no extra; AE rides the **Comp/Coll** deductible on the vehicle.
- **Limits:** Quote up to **$10k** in-system; >$10k submit for approval (up to ~$50k typical).

### 🔧 Lifted / lowered vehicles
- Rule of thumb: **±4 inches** from stock is generally the ceiling for standard acceptance.  
  Bigger lifts may be declined or require special handling.

### ⏱️ New mods just added?
- Contract gives a **30‑day window** to report newly acquired AE **and** Farmers must have been willing to insure it. **Tell clients: “Call us the day you add it.”**

🟦 **Colorado tip:** Hail & wraps are common. Make sure **wrap/graphics** are listed as AE (actual cost), and consider **glass buyback** (below).

---

## 🪟 Glass & Comp quick hits
- 🪨 **Rock chip repair**: deductible **waived** when repaired (not replaced).
- 🪟 **Safety Glass Deductible Buyback**: windshield (and other **safety glass**) to **$100** deductible.  
  *Note: MN/CT often $0 by rule; elsewhere typically $100.*
- 🌩️ **One event, multiple cars (SPA feature):** if the **same** insured loss (e.g., hail/tree) hits several of your insured cars, only the **lowest** Comp/Coll **deductible** applies across them.

🟦 **Colorado tip:** Front Range hail = frequent glass claims. Recommend **glass buyback** + keep a chip repair script ready.

---

## 🧰 Towing & Roadside (TRS)
**Call first:** **1‑800‑FARM‑TOW** (or HelpPoint via the app). Farmers’ network = contracted rates.  
If you self-arrange, submit **reimbursement** with invoice (must be **reasonable & necessary**).

### What’s covered (labor at disablement site or a tow — one or the other)
- 🔋 Jump start
- 🔑 Lockout
- 🛞 Tire change (you supply tire)
- 🛢️ Fuel delivery *(fuel cost paid once per policy period)*
- 🚚 Tow to repair facility

### Key limits / caveats
- 🛣️ Vehicle must be within **100 ft** of a public road (no deep off-road recoveries).
- 🚫 Not for: RVs/motorhomes, motorcycles, **stored** cars (and similar exclusions per policy).
- 🔁 **>3 TRS claims in 12 months** on the same car → TRS removed from that car.
- 🚗 **Rental cars**: may qualify **by definition** of “your insured car,” but dispatch can’t verify; pay & submit invoice with rental agreement.

🟦 **Colorado tip:** SPA rules apply; use Farmers dispatch in storms (hail events spike retail tow rates).  
🟧 **Texas exception:** TRS is sold as **$40 / $80 / $120 per tow** limits; elsewhere it’s “reasonable & necessary.”

---

## 🚘 Rental Transportation Options
You can carry **either or both** (on different cars) — but not both on the same car.

### 1) 💥 Collision Plus (“K-coverages”)
- **K4:** $25/day up to **20 days** (**$500** max) + **K3** benefit (up to $200) for returning the repaired vehicle.
- **K5:** $50/day up to **20 days** (**$1,000** max) + K3 benefit (up to $500 return-to-you cost).  
- **Auto-pays** at close of claim for **each day** the car is down after a **covered Comp/Coll loss exceeding the deductible**. You **don’t** have to rent to collect.
- 🔁 **Strategy:** On new/expensive cars, raise Coll deductible a notch and add **K5** to buy down real-world downtime.

### 2) 🚗 Rental Reimbursement (RR)
- Pick **$30 / $50 / $100 per day**, up to **30 days** for a **covered** Comp/Coll loss exceeding the deductible.
- **Reimburses** the actual rental charge (not gas, mileage, or the rental company’s CDW/LDW).

🟦 **Colorado tip:** After hail or CAT events, rental prices **spike** and fleets sell out. For professionals who must stay mobile, consider **$100/day RR** on the primary commuter.

## 🧳 Trailers & Campers
### Liability while towing
- When attached to **your insured vehicle**, your **auto liability** follows for **BI/PD**.

### Physical damage options by type
- 🛠️ **Utility trailers** (you own): list & cover on **Auto** (utility trailer option).  
  - Borrowed utility trailer: SPA includes **$500** PD; usually not enough → advise the owner uses their policy or get a rider.
- 🧭 **Travel trailers** (Airstream/toy hauler/5th wheel):  
  - Can endorse **Comp/Coll** on **Auto** (set **full value**; deductible independent of the tow vehicle).  
  - Or write a **Foremost** specialty policy for broader coverages (contents, awnings/sat dishes, emergency expense, breakdown, total loss replacement) **plus** a multi-policy discount on Farmers Auto in many states.
- 🏕️ **Slide-in campers** (bed-mounted): use **Camper Endorsement** on **Auto** (not AE). Deductibles **must match** the truck’s Comp/Coll.

### Towing for trailer/camper itself
- Extra hookup miles/fees for towing a **trailer/camper** are **not covered** by vehicle TRS **unless** TRS is **added** for the trailer/camper endorsement.

🟦 **Colorado tip:** Many clients recreate in-state; default to **Foremost** if they carry meaningful contents or camp for extended periods. Add value for **awnings/satellite/solar** by rolling into the unit’s insured value.

## 🎯 Special Exclusions refresher (common pitfalls)
- 🚫 **Rideshare / delivery** (Uber/Lyft/DoorDash, etc.) — excluded without **rideshare endorsement**; platform provides limited periods.  
- 🚫 **Personal car sharing** (Turo, etc.) — excluded on Personal Auto.  
- 🚫 **Racing/track / performance events** — no coverage on a track or performance course.  
- 🚫 **Intentional acts / criminal eluding** — excluded.  
- 🚫 **Own property PD** (e.g., back into your own garage) — liability won’t pay yourself.  
- 🚫 **Property rented to/used by you** (tools, scaffolding, bounce houses) — excluded under auto liability.  
- 🚫 **“Assumed liability”** by handshake (“I’ll put it on my insurance if I wreck your car”) — excluded (rental contracts are carved out).  
- 🚫 **Non-owned vehicle available for regular use** (roommate’s car with keys on the hook) — excluded under your policy.  
- 🚫 **Consignment lot theft** — excluded while in care of a seller unless otherwise arranged.  
- 🚓 **Emergency occupations**: your **own** car is fine; **others’ emergency vehicles** are excluded under your auto (their policy responds).

🟦 **Colorado tip:** **Rideshare endorsement** is available; educate on gap periods. Hail CATs also amplify the need for **RR** and **glass**.

## 💳 Residual Debt (GAP) — Farmers version
**What it is:** If the car is **totaled**, Farmers’ residual debt coverage pays up to **25% of ACV** **(cap)** toward the loan “gap.”

- Example: ACV = $25,000 → GAP benefit cap = **$6,250**.  
- If payoff is $31,000, ACV ($25k) + GAP ($6.25k) ≈ **$31.25k** → likely covered.  
- If payoff is $35,000, ACV ($25k) + GAP ($6.25k) = **$31.25k** → **shortfall remains**.  
- Dealer GAP is usually **broader** (but pricier). Position fairly: *“If your loan-to-value is tight or you rolled in negative equity, dealer GAP may be safer; otherwise our residual debt can be a cost‑effective backstop.”*

🟦 **Colorado tip:** New-car buyers often face rapid depreciation. If rolling in taxes/fees/negative equity, discuss **dealer GAP vs Farmers residual debt** transparently.

## 🗣️ Micro-scripts you can use
- **AE discovery:** “Anything not factory? Wheels, wrap, lift, electronics, hitches? If it’s hard‑mounted, let’s list it so it’s paid properly.”
- **Glass buyback:** “Since hail/rocks are common here, $100 glass buyback keeps windshield costs predictable.”
- **Rideshare:** “Once your app is on, your personal coverage steps back and the platform’s periods kick in. The endorsement fills the early gap.”
- **Trailers:** “We can put your travel trailer on Auto for basic PD, but Foremost adds contents, awnings, and emergency expense for trips.”
- **K5 vs RR:** “K5 pays you for each day the car’s down—no rental required. RR reimburses an actual rental up to your daily limit.”

---

## ✅ Quick placement checklist
- AE listed w/ values (wraps, lifts, hitches, glass buyback offered)  
- Rideshare use screened; endorsement if applicable  
- TRS added (and client knows to **call Farmers first**)  
- Rental plan chosen (K5 for downtime cash **or** RR for actual rental — sometimes both on different cars)  
- Trailer/camper routed to correct form (Foremost if contents/long trips)  
- Residual debt vs Dealer GAP discussed (note client choice)

---

## 🔍 Self‑check (5 Qs)
1) Client adds a **tonneau cover**. Covered automatically? → **No. Must be endorsed as AE under SPA.**  
2) Same hailstorm hits 3 insured cars. Deductibles? → **Only the lowest Comp/Coll deductible applies (SPA).**  
3) Drives for **Uber**, app ON, no passenger yet. Covered? → **Personal auto excludes; platform provides limited 50/100/25‑type period; rideshare endorsement recommended.**  
4) Needs **rental** but wants cash instead. Which option? → **K‑coverage (K4/K5).**  
5) Travel trailer with $3k awning & $2k solar. How to rate on Auto? → **Set unit value to full amount (trailer + attached gear). Consider Foremost for broader coverage.**

### 🧩 Handy references (to remember)
- **AE auto-include:** $1,000 with Comp/Coll  
- **Lift rule:** ±4" typical  
- **Glass buyback:** $100 (MN/CT often $0)

- **RR:** $30/$50/$100 per day × up to 30 days  
- **Residual debt cap:** 25% of ACV
