## 🎯 What qualifies as an <span class="hi">Antique Auto</span> (Farmers)
- **Age:** ≥ **25 years** old.  
- **Type:** *Private passenger auto* (cars or light trucks).  
- **Condition:** *Restored or maintained in its original condition.* (Repaint/graphics OK; heavy chassis/engine/suspension mods are **not**.)  
- **Use:** Exhibitions, **car club** activities, **parades**, other **public-interest** functions — plus *“occasionally for other purposes.”*

<div class="call small">
<b>Occasional personal use</b> is fine (e.g., Sunday drive, coffee run). <b>Not</b> OK: using it primarily for commuting or daily passenger transport.
</div>

---

## 🧩 Photos & Appraisals
- **Photos required** at binding: **front+side** or **rear+side** (clear exterior views).  
- **Appraisal:** not required at quoting/binding; <span class="lo">becomes critical at claim</span> to establish value.

<div class="hrule"></div>

## 💵 Rating & Policy Setup (Farmers)
- Choose **Antique** policy type at start (different rating workflow).  
- **Comp:** 100% of normal rate.  
- **Collision:** ~**20%** of normal rate (limited use discount).  
- **Liability/UM/Med:** steeply discounted (≈10–12% of standard), but **no** affinity/specialty/multi-car discounts apply.  
- **VINs:** many antiques have short VINs — **left‑pad with zeros** to 17 chars.  
- **Model on dec page:** system may show **“Other.”** Overwrite to the real model name so the dec page looks right.

<div class="call-warn small">
If you don’t pick <b>Antique</b> at the very beginning, you won’t get the correct program/rates — and you can’t “convert” later. Start over if mis-selected.
</div>

---

## 🛡️ Physical Damage Value Logic (Farmers Antique Endorsement)
- You enter an **appraised/declared amount** to **determine premium**,  
  but settlement follows policy language: **repair/replace up to ACV** at loss time (not guaranteed/agreed value).  
- Keep the declared amount **current**; document upgrades.

<div class="call small">
Want a true <b>Agreed Value</b> settlement? Place with a specialty market (e.g., <b>Hagerty</b>/JC Taylor) that locks the dollar figure up-front.
</div>

---

## ❌ Common Declines (Farmers Antique / Standard Auto)
- **Kit/replica vehicles** (e.g., Cobra kit, MG kit, Caterham, Porsche Speedster replica).  
- **Race/track vehicles**, slicks, roll-cages, logbooks, or obvious competition setup.  
- **Heavily modified** performance builds (blowers, nitrous, extreme lowers/lifts).  
- **Over-lifted** trucks (> ~4" raise/lower).  
- **Commercial/utility/off-road** vehicles (active use).

<div class="call-stop small">
If you unknowingly place a racer/kit in standard or Antique, claims/underwriting will kick it — and it reflects on your agency. Always get interior/engine photos.
</div>

## ✅ Perfect Fits for <span class="hi">Specialty Markets</span> (Hagerty / JC Taylor)
<div class="grid">
  <div class="card">
    <b>They LOVE</b><br>
    • Antiques & classics (cars/trucks) <br>
    • Modified street rods, lowriders, tuners (with rules) <br>
    • Exotics/supercars (usage & driver criteria) <br>
    • Military classics (weapons <i>disabled</i>) <br>
    • Vehicles under restoration (“in‑process” values) <br>
    • Collections + automobilia/tools; evacuation expense
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <b>Typical Rules</b><br>
    • <b>Agreed Value</b> settlements (they appraise/confirm) <br>
    • Usage limits (annual mileage bands; no track use) <br>
    • Secure storage (no street/lot parking) <br>
    • Driver MVR screens (e.g., no DUIs/reckless; “excessive speed”) <br>
    • Some categories need <b>min values</b> (e.g., tuners ≥ $30k)
  </div>
</div>

<div class="hrule"></div>

## 🧠 Quote Flow — Fast Talk Track
1) **What is it?** Antique original vs. kit/replica vs. modified build.  
2) **How’s it used/stored?** Shows, club, parades; secure garage? Any commuting? Any track time?  
3) **Where to place?**  
   - **Original, light mods + occasional use:** try **Farmers Antique**.  
   - **Kit/replica, heavy mods, exotics, restorations, collections, military, tuners/lowriders:** **Hagerty / JC Taylor**.  
4) **Value & docs:** photos now; appraisal if specialty/claim-prone.  
5) **Set expectations:** ACV vs. Agreed Value, usage limits, and decline triggers.

---

## 📝 Micro‑Scripts (client-facing)
- **Eligibility framing:** “Because it’s 25+ years and mostly original, we can use our Antique program—big savings on liability/collision.”  
- **When to pivot:** “Since it’s a Cobra replica with performance mods, specialty markets like Hagerty give you **Agreed Value** and are built for this.”  
- **Occasional use boundary:** “Shows, parades, weekend drives are perfect. Daily commuting would move it out of Antique pricing.”

---

## 🔎 Spotters’ Guide (photos to request)
- Exterior: **front+side** or **rear+side** (full vehicle).  
- **Engine bay & interior** (catch blowers, tach/roll cage, fuel cells).  
- Undercarriage/hubs (lift/lower evidence).  
- Storage: garage/barn (prove secure).

## 🧭 Decision Matrix

| Vehicle | Condition | Use/Storage | Market | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ’55 Chevy, original | Restored OEM | Shows, parades, garaged | **Farmers Antique** | Discounted liability/collision |
| ’68 Mustang, lowered w/ tach | Performance mods | Weekend cruises | **Hagerty/JCT** | Mods push to specialty |
| Cobra kit/replica | Kit | Limited use | **Hagerty/JCT** | Agreed Value only |
| Over‑lifted ’75 4x4 | 8–10" lift | Off‑road | **Decline (Farmers)** → Specialty? | Storage & use scrutinized |
| Vintage military Jeep | Original, de‑fanged | Shows | **Hagerty/JCT** | **Weapons disabled** |
| Antique bus/truck | Original/retired | Displays | **Hagerty/JCT** | No active commercial hauling |

---

## 🧯 Specialty Extras (Hagerty highlights)
- **Agreed Value** settlement in writing.  
- **Evacuation expense** (e.g., wildfire/tornado): 50% of cost up to **$250 per vehicle** to move cars out of harm’s way.  
- **Collections program:** dedicated reps, automatic new‑purchase coverage, quarterly value increases.  
- **Automobilia/tools** coverage for displays, signage, parts.

---

## 🚫 Track & Competition
- No standard market covers on‑track use. Some specialty will cover **off‑track** exposure for race cars (storage/transport), but **not competition**.

---

## 📦 Quick Reminders
- **Tonneau covers** etc. belong to equipment discussions (Auto 107); antique focus is vehicle eligibility/value/use.  
- When in doubt, **submit photos** and ask UW **before** binding.
