# Auto 104 — Policy Language Part II

> **Purpose:** Give agents a fast, practical reference you can use at the scene, during first-call triage, and across the claims lifecycle—plus clear explainers for clients.

---

## 🔑 <span style="color:#2E86C1">1) Big Ideas (Fast Takeaways)</span>
- <span style="color:#C0392B">Document refusals</span>. If a client rejects higher limits/UM-UIM, keep a signed declination or email record.
- <span style="color:#27AE60">Serve care first, then logistics</span>. Start with safety (“Are you ok? Are you safe?”), then collect facts, then loop in claims.
- <span style="color:#AF7AC5">Follow up next day</span>. Soft-tissue injuries often manifest 12–24h later; call **tomorrow**, then **again in 3–5 days**.
- <span style="color:#E67E22">Territory matters</span>. US + Territories + Puerto Rico + Canada = **covered**. Mexico = **no liability**.
- <span style="color:#F1C40F">Canada rentals</span>: Need proof of high limits. Issue **Canadian ID card** to avoid buying expensive counter coverage.
- <span style="color:#E74C3C">Mexico</span>: Liability **not covered**. Only limited comp/collision (conditions apply). Always buy **Mexican insurance**.
- <span style="color:#1ABC9C">UM/UIM is the client’s safety net</span>. Other drivers often carry low limits—advise robust UM/UIM to cover gaps.
- <span style="color:#34495E">Insured person definition matters</span>. You, family members, and permissive occupants. Watch out for students away at college vs. fully moved out.
- <span style="color:#D35400">Rideshare excluded</span> under personal auto.
- <span style="color:#7D3C98">Hit-and-run rules differ</span>. Some require **physical contact**.

## 📝 <span style="color:#2E86C1">2) First-Call Accident Triage Script (Agent)</span>
**Care First (always lead with empathy):**
- “<span style="color:#27AE60">Are you safe right now?</span> Is anyone injured?”  
- “Is your vehicle in a safe place off the road?”  
- “Have you called the police/EMS?”

**Collect Facts (while fresh):**
- Who was in your car, injuries, witness info.  
- Scene details: time, location, controls, weather.  
- Other party: names, insurer, policy #, phone, license, plate, VIN.  
- Photos: damage, positions, cards, area.  
- Police report/incident #.

**Next Steps (set expectations):**
- Warm transfer claims (3-way call).  
- Schedule **T+1** and **T+3–5 day** check-ins.  
- Remind about medical attention for delayed pain.

## 🌍 <span style="color:#2E86C1">3) Territory & Travel Highlights</span>
- <span style="color:#27AE60">Covered</span>: US, Puerto Rico, Canada, cars shipped between ports.  
- <span style="color:#F1C40F">Canada rentals</span>: Must show proof of high limits; otherwise must buy rental insurance.  
- <span style="color:#E74C3C">Mexico</span>: No liability coverage. Only restricted comp/collision near border if **you/family/listed U.S. drivers**. Always buy **Mexican policy**.

---

## 🚦 <span style="color:#2E86C1">4) UM/UIM Essentials</span>
- Protects against drivers with **low or no coverage**.  
- Pays what insured is **legally entitled to recover** (medical, wages, pain/suffering).  
- Covers: You, resident relatives, passengers, and often while walking/cycling.  
- Not covered: Rideshare use, roommate’s regularly available car, scooters/e-bikes (not registered).  
- **Client script:** “If someone with low insurance seriously injures you, how much should we pay?” → “All of it” → Offer **500k+ limits + umbrella**.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 <span style="color:#2E86C1">5) Family & Household Scenarios</span>
- College students away = still family member (if listed).  
- Post-graduation & moved out = usually not family member anymore.  
- Excluded driver as passenger = covered as occupant.  
- Roommates = tricky for UM/UIM.  
- Elders living in home = family members.

---

## 🛠️ <span style="color:#2E86C1">6) Quick Agent Playbook</span>
- **Follow-ups**: T+1 (well-being), T+3–5 (repairs), T+14 (progress).  
- **3-way call with claims**: Collect facts, then patch in HelpPoint.  
- **Document declinations** of high limits/UM/UIM.  
- **Stay proactive** with 3rd-party carriers—your client blames you for delays.

## 🟣 Colorado-Specific Notes

### 🚦 UM/UIM in Colorado
- **High uninsured rate**: Colorado historically sits above the national average (~16% of drivers have no insurance).
- **Mandatory UM/UIM offer**: Carriers must **offer UM/UIM equal to BI limits** unless rejected in writing.  
  <span style="color:#C0392B">Agent Tip:</span> Always keep a signed declination on file — E&O protection.
- **Stacking**: Colorado generally does **not allow stacking** UM/UIM across multiple policies unless explicitly stated.

---

### 🏔️ Territory & Travel
- **Ski trips into Canada** (Whistler, Banff, Alberta): Remind clients they’ll need a **Canadian ID card** showing high BI limits to rent vehicles.  
- **Mexico spring break drives**: Popular with Colorado families. Stress that Farmers provides **no liability coverage** in Mexico; recommend Zurich/Kraft Lake Cross-Border options.

---

### 💰 State Minimums (Colorado)
- Current minimum BI limits: **25/50/15**.  
- <span style="color:#E67E22">These are dangerously low</span> compared to Denver/Boulder healthcare and wage costs.  
- Position higher limits as protection against fast exhaustion of coverage.

---

### 📑 Accident Handling in Colorado
- **State Patrol/Local Police** may not respond to minor Denver-area accidents. Encourage clients to file a **DR 2447 Accident Report** through DMV if officers don’t appear.  
- **Delayed injury claims** (esp. ski/rafting) are common. Strongly reinforce **T+1 day follow-up** to capture new pain/soft-tissue injuries.

---

### 🏥 Colorado MedPay Requirement
- All auto policies must include **$5,000 MedPay** by default (can only be declined in writing).  
- Pays initial medical costs regardless of fault.  
- Hospitals often **bill MedPay first** in Colorado — prepare clients for this so they’re not surprised.

---

### 🧾 Lawsuits & Statutes in Colorado
- **Statute of limitations:**  
  - **3 years** for auto accident bodily injury/property damage.  
  - **2 years** for wrongful death.  
- Suit papers can arrive years later. <span style="color:#C0392B">Always forward immediately to claims.</span>
