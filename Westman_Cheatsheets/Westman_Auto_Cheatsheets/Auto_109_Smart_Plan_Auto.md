## Discounts vs. Rating Factors

<div style="border-left:6px solid #22c55e; background:#ecfdf5; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>Discounts</b> always reduce premium (when qualified). Some validate automatically; others need proof (affinity, good student, etc.).
</div>

<div style="border-left:6px solid #0ea5e9; background:#f0f9ff; padding:14px; border-radius:10px; margin-top:10px;">
<b>Rating factors</b> can move premium up or down (credit/“FACET”, prior limits/insurance, territory, household mix, vehicle symbols, mileage, etc.). These are calculated—no line‑item “discount” shows.
</div>

## Multi‑line & Relationship Discounts

### Affinity Group (examples)
<div style="border-left:6px solid #0ea5e9; background:#f0f9ff; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>Common qualifiers:</b> K‑12 teachers/administrators (public teachers typically simpler), scientists (BS/BA/MS/PhD in qualifying fields), retired occupations (e.g., teachers, military with DD‑214).
<br/><b>Key rule:</b> Qualifying person must be the <u>Primary or Secondary Named Insured</u> on the policy to apply to the household.
<br/><b>Proof tips:</b> District/credential lookup screenshot, employer letter/paystub (≤90 days for retirees), DD‑214 for retired military. <i>Social profiles (LinkedIn/Facebook) don’t count.</i>
</div>

### Auto + Home (and related)
- **Auto/Home (Farmers)** — Stackable core bundle. % varies by state.
- **Auto/Renters (Farmers)** — Applies with Farmers renters.
- **Auto/Mobile Home (Foremost)** — Valid only when the <i>Foremost</i> policy shows a <b>Farmers</b> agent of record.
- **Auto/Brokered Home (via Kraft Lake)** — Eligible for owner‑occupied home, dwelling fire (owner‑occupied), or farm & ranch placed through Kraft Lake.
- **Auto/Business (Farmers Commercial & Zurich Small Business)** — 2% when Named Insured/spouse is owner/partner/officer. Workers’ Comp alone doesn’t qualify.
- **Auto/Life (Farmers Life)** — Owner is PNI/spouse; face amount ≥ $50k <u>at issue</u>; insured ≥ 18 at issue. Drops if decreasing term falls < $50k.
- **Auto/Specialty (Foremost toys)** — Boats, motorcycles, travel trailers, ORVs; line‑by‑line stacking (e.g., Boat + MC = add both %s). Zip and Named Insureds must match.
- **Umbrella (Farmers Personal Umbrella)** — Discount only when the umbrella is written with Farmers (not brokered).

<div style="border-left:6px solid #f59e0b; background:#fffbeb; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>Watchouts:</b> Boyfriend/girlfriend combos without insurable interest don’t qualify as “family” for multi‑car. Moving a qualifying child into the home won’t apply affinity unless they are PNI/SNI (which can break other bundle logic).
</div>

## Billing & Paperless

- **Paid in Full** — Earned if the full renewal is paid by the due date (partial early payment is fine; just finish by the bill date).
- **Good Payer** — Everyone gets it at new business; lost after a late/NSF and returns after 12 months clean.
- **EFT monthly** — Discount (vs. a surcharge for paper‑billed monthly). Net swing between EFT and non‑EFT monthly is typically 5% (−2% vs. +3%).
- **ePolicy / Paperless** — Additional savings where available.

<div style="border-left:6px solid #22c55e; background:#ecfdf5; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>Pro move:</b> If a client owes $800 and pays $400 early, they still get <i>Paid in Full</i> <u>if</u> they complete payment by the due date. Don’t let that discount slip—process payment in‑office when timing is tight.
</div>

## Youthful Drivers & Students

### Youthful Driver Discount
- Applies to the youngest rated driver (< 25) once the household has been on <b>Smart Plan Auto</b> ≥ 12 months (prior legacy FA2 time doesn’t count). Transfer from another state with ≥ 12 months SPA may carry eligibility.

### Good Student (typically 3.0+)
- Qualify with latest completed term <i>or</i> cumulative GPA (HS/college). Dean’s List/Honor Roll accepted when no letter grades.
- Homeschool: top 20% on recognized standardized test.
- Re‑qualify once after the 19th birthday; then it typically persists through college.
- Ends at marriage or when aging out per state rules.

### Student Away (100+ miles, no regular access)
- 10% driver‑level discount (varies by state). Must not have regular access to a vehicle.
- Keep students on the policy for coverage: rental cars, permissive use, UM/UIM as passenger or pedestrian, and to preserve continuous insurance history.

### “On Your Own” Discount
- For drivers < 25 who move out and keep Farmers: ~10 years of sliding savings (starts ~10% and steps down each renewal).

### Shared Family Car
- More rated drivers than vehicles (e.g., 4 drivers / 3 cars) with a youthful driver—system applies a sharing factor automatically.

<div style="border-left:6px solid #ef4444; background:#fef2f2; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>Coverage reminder:</b> Dropping a student to “save money” can remove critical protections (e.g., when driving a friend’s minimally‑insured car or as an injured passenger/pedestrian). Keep them named if you want those coverages.
</div>

## Household‑Level Rating Factors (calculated)

- **Average Driver Factor** — Uses the highest‑rated subset (e.g., up to 3 of 4+) to price the household. Changes as drivers/grades/tickets change.
- **Deceased Driver Rate Stabilizer** — Smooths the pricing change when a spouse passes (transition from married → single over several renewals).
- **Early Shopper** — Quote bound ≥ 7 days before effective earns a factor improvement.
- **Market Tier** — Combines credit (“FACET”), underwriting signals, and single vs. multi‑vehicle.
- **Prior Insurance/Limits** — Higher prior limits generally rate better than state minimums; gaps can hurt.
- **Household Structure** — Marital status, primary/secondary NI, driver count/mix.
- **Reinstatement History** — Recent lapses/reinstatements (e.g., past 12 months) impact pricing.
- **Territory/Zip** — Local loss costs (repairs, medical, litigation, theft) flow into rating.

---

## Vehicle‑Level Rating Factors (calculated)

- **Business Use** — Realtor/gig/other business use can surcharge (liability exposure).
- **Alternative Fuel/Hybrid** — VIN‑based savings where applicable.
- **Comp‑Only Vehicles** — Comp‑only tends to have higher claim frequency → surcharge.
- **“Full Coverage” Combo Factor** — Having liability + UM/UIM + comp + collision often yields a favorable factor (naming varies by state).
- **Model Year** — Age of vehicle affects severity/repairability factors.
- **Leased vs. Owned** — Leased vehicles often rate higher for physical damage (turn‑in standards drive more claims); liability factor unchanged.
- **Luxury Vehicle ↔ Credit Group** — Interaction factor (e.g., high‑end vehicle + weak credit can rate higher; strong credit can mitigate).
- **Safety/Symbols** — Airbags/ABS/collision‑avoidance and loss symbols flow through the VIN.

<div style="border-left:6px solid #f59e0b; background:#fffbeb; padding:14px; border-radius:10px;">
<b>VIN matters:</b> Enter VINs and financing/lease status correctly before you quote—symbols, safety equipment, and lease factors materially change price.
</div>

## Signal (Telematics)
Availability and rules differ by state. Expect driving‑behavior scoring to influence renewal pricing/discounts; check your state’s Signal brief for enrollment steps, data points, and reward schedules.

---

## Documentation Cheatsheet
- **Affinity — Teachers**: Public K‑12 (license/credential lookup). Private K‑12 may require 3‑year in‑state proof and degree copy per state rules.
- **Affinity — Scientists**: Degree in qualifying field (BS/BA/MS/PhD). Applies even if current job is unrelated.
- **Retired**: Employer retirement letter or current pension paystub (≤90 days). Military: DD‑214.
- **Homeowner Discount**: Tax bill, HO dec page (any carrier), flood dec page—must be primary residence (not rental/mobile home for this discount).

### Fast Q&A

**Q: Does partial prepayment earn Paid‑in‑Full?**  
A: Yes—so long as the <i>entire</i> amount is received by the due date.

**Q: My FA2 client rewrites to Smart Plan Auto today—does their 16‑year‑old get the youthful driver factor?**  
A: Not until the household has 12 months on Smart Plan Auto (FA2 time doesn’t count).

**Q: Student takes car to UCLA—do we rate by CA zip or home state?**  
A: While a dependent away at school, the policy typically rates at the household’s primary residence (confirm local rules).

**Q: Who has to be Named Insured for affinity to carry to the whole household?**  
A: The qualifying person must be PNI/SNI.
