- 🚙 Denver/Boulder rideshare density → **endorsements or commercial policies** essential.  
- 🌨️ Colorado glass claims are extremely common due to I-70/Front Range gravel use → push **$100 safety glass buyback**.  
- 🏔️ Mountain towing: highlight **reasonable & necessary** coverage; note 100 ft rule may limit off-road recoveries.
